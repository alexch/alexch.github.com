<span class="entry-title entry-content">There&#39;s not much of a point in here. We&#39;re supposed to feel bad because Chinese people have jobs making products that Americans buy. And because Apple didn&#39;t deliver on some vague idea of openness.<br /><br />Ironic given that the app store is the center of an explosion of creativity. It&#39;s amazing. Consumers have spoken - on this particular platform, at this time, they want a walled garden, and if Apple is wrong about this then they risk disruption in the long-term. Tech people don&#39;t like it, they wish consumers would want something else. But given vibrant competition among app store models I don&#39;t see what the moral problem is. <br /><br />Uttering &quot;Big Brother&quot; in the face of this:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site%3Akillscreendaily.com+ios" >http://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site%3Akillscreendaily.com+ios</a><br /><br />completely discredits a writer, IMO.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Daisey answers one of your points straight on: &quot;We can admire the design perfection and business acumen while acknowledging the truth: with Apple’s immense resources at his command he could have revolutionized the industry to make devices more humanely and more openly, and chose not to.&quot; One could argue that the 1997 or 2004 Apple needed to cut corners, but 2011 Apple can surely stand to take a potential financial hit in order to push for more humane working conditions for their contractors.<br /><br />Your other point is fallacious. (False dilemma? Counterfactual?) Just because consumers chose X does not mean they would not also or instead have chosen Y. Where Y is an iOS device with slightly less draconian restrictions on content, enabling a new generation of Apple kids to hack the devices their parents bought them, just like you and I did. <br /><br />And X is a device with <b>so</b> many advantages that it&#39;s impossible to separate their effects in a hypothetical. Were consumers happy with the walled garden? Or with the great usability design? Or the Retina display? Or with the AT&amp;T service? You could have said, &quot;Consumers have spoken - on this particular platform, at this time, they want crappy coverage and expensive data plans, and if Apple is wrong about this then they risk disruption in the long-term.&quot;<br /><br />Did you ever type CALL -151 on an Apple ][? Or PEEK(-16336)? If so, you know what I&#39;m talking about.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Also, by &quot;more humane working conditions&quot; I don&#39;t mean putting scented candles in the break room. These people are forced to work 12-hour shifts standing on their feet with no breaks -- no snacks, no lunch, no bathroom -- performing incredibly minute, repetitive tasks. The Foxconn plant had a rash of suicides; their response was to put up nets and force workers to sign a pledge not to kill themselves. Not an Onion article; that really happened. As Chris Hayes pointed out, when workers organize into unions, their first demands are not for pay or benefits, they are for work rules, like breaks.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn#Controversies" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn#Controversies</a></span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Nick: I recognize this:<br /><br /><a href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/smokey.html" >http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/smokey.html</a><br /><br />Even in China labor forced labor is not common practice. It may be a shit job, but shit jobs are nothing new.<br /><br />Alex: &quot;Where Y is an iOS device with slightly less draconian restrictions on content, enabling a new generation of Apple kids to hack the devices their parents bought them, just like you and I did. &quot;<br /><br />So I&#39;m trying to figure out why Apple would have decided on a walled garden. Because that&#39;s just how they roll? Do you really think that this doesn&#39;t have something to do with making the platform in general and the app store in particular more successful?<br /><br />I can certainly imagine a conversation like this: &quot;remember the Palm days when people installed 3rd party apps from anywhere, and the apps caused corruption of the device? Where performance was terrible, and UI decisions fairly arbitrary? We don&#39;t want that experience.&quot;<br /><br />In general it&#39;s like Apple gave you a Model T and what you really wanted was a levitation device and now you&#39;re disappointed. The smartphone world prior to Apple&#39;s entry was absolutely terrible. Now not only are there good devices, but they&#39;ve solved the distribution+expectations problem such that developers can actually make money off of software distributed online. They don&#39;t have to rely on ads and goodwill.<br /><br />So you want a more open platform. Undoubtedly what Apple has done will become commodity at some point, and if they&#39;re not smart it&#39;ll get disrupted. Depending on how hung up you are on TOS, you can pay $25 and start distributing apps (still with certain restrictions!) today through Google Android market. It&#39;s a competitive landscape gurgling with different models, you can choose what you like.<br /><br />What I think you want is for one winner to make all the &quot;right&quot; decisions - not only to succeed in the face of technology, business, and adoption challenges, but to go beyond that and be a saint (in your estimation).<br /><br />&quot;Consumers have spoken - on this particular platform, at this time, they want crappy coverage and expensive data plans, and if Apple is wrong about this then they risk disruption in the long-term.&quot; &lt;-- that&#39;s not Apple, that&#39;s wireless carriers, and ironically, yes they do risk not just long-term disruption, but medium-term at best.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">What you and Krugman miss (false dilemma again!) is that not all shit jobs are created equal. Bathroom breaks are a basic human right.<br /><br />PKrug (in that undated essay) says &quot;Why does the image of an Indonesian sewing sneakers for 60 cents an hour evoke so much more feeling than the image of another Indonesian earning the equivalent of 30 cents an hour trying to feed his family on a tiny plot of land -- or of a Filipino scavenging on a garbage heap? The main answer, I think, is a sort of fastidiousness. Unlike the starving subsistence farmer, the women and children in the sneaker factory are working at slave wages for our benefit -- and this makes us feel unclean.&quot; -- While that might be part of it, a less condescending analysis shows that the factory workers being tortured (yeah, I said it) are under our (and Apple&#39;s) direct influence. Krugman is looking down from orbit while we are in much closer proximity. <br /><br />It&#39;s about morality, not economics. If some crazy dude is kicking a dog to death on the sidewalk, will you interfere, or will you tut tut about people not spaying their pets, which leads to more stray and unloved animals, of which this is a sad but inevitable consequence, and walk on by?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The morality you talk about is in its effect amoral. You would raise the price of doing business such that it eliminates opportunities that poorer people decide are in their own interest, and the motivation is a vague rich-westerner guilt centered around consumer products.<br /><br />The much better way to go about this is to encourage the industrialization+modernization process - let billions become middle class and they themselves will demand and receive the attendant better working conditions. Modern South Koreans and Taiwanese work in much different conditions than their great-grandparents.<br /><br />This is real progress. Rich-westerner guilt has a terrible track record in actually affecting real change for the better for poor people.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">It&#39;s true, the right thing is to save the dog. And give him a bathroom break if he needs one on the way to the vet. And pick up the poop and throw it away. And make sure the trash company is not enslaving or otherwise abusing its workers. Better get some people to check on the local gov&#39;t to make sure that&#39;s getting done. So we&#39;ll need help to check into corruption, too.<br /><br />Damn, doing the right thing is a lot of work. Fuck it, next time I see a guy beating a dog to death I&#39;m going to shoot him, take his money, sell his clothes and possessions on ebay (except his ipad, that&#39;s worth keeping), and train the dog to protect me and attack the next unlucky fool I meet on the street.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Nick - see the economic history of now-rich Asian countries since WW2.<br /><br />&quot;Do you honestly think that the marginal cost of allowing workers to have bathroom breaks during a 12 hour shift would cause a huge company like Foxconn to lose any competitive advantage? Especially if it&#39;s tied to keeping their biggest customer happy?&quot;<br /><br />Foxconn thinks so, at least. I&#39;m pretty sure, aside from whether this particular practice is actually effective, they&#39;re not completely irrational, and that they&#39;re trying to run a successful business. It&#39;s in the same category as poorly lit facilities and bad or nonexistent safety equipment + regulation you see across the asian manufacturing world - these practices mean the difference between a manufacturing facility that&#39;s competitive and one that&#39;s not.<br /><br />Speaking of colonialism, why don&#39;t we let the Chinese figure out what&#39;s best for them as they industrialize?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">8,000 people a day apply for a job at Foxconn. People literally pay money to get a job there.

Shouldn&#39;t we allow people to improve their lives?<br /><br />The irony here is that because Foxconn has taken so much grief, they&#39;re investing in more robotic operations and will be few people.

Nope, they get fired and thrown back onto the trash heap.<br /><br />The CEO of Apple is in a unique position to actually exert influence that Bono and Obama and any individual consumer can&#39;t. That makes it a direct moral choice.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Nick I object to assumption that Foxconn is at fault for every employee who commits suicide while employed there. That assumption is no more valid than blaming the city of SF for every person who died by jumping off the Golden Gate bridge.<br /><br />@Alex Coercion is being locked inside and factory and forced to work. Coercion is having Nazi soldiers invade your home land. Coercion is not paying a job agency for a job at Foxconn in which the working conditions are widely known. Over 300k work for Foxconn at the Shenzhen factory. The turn-over rate is high. No one is in the dark about the working conditions.<br /><br />Again, most Foxconn workers stay for about 3 months, save like hell, then return to their family to help with the debt or to invest in the family&#39;s farm. <br /><br />RSIs take time to develop. Maybe you can get one in 3 months, but I&#39;m inclined to think that the risk is low for long term damage.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a problem with Apple setting work condition standards for their suppliers. I don&#39;t have a problem with the workers unionizing to demand better treatment. It won&#39;t happen though, no one is there long enough to care.<br /><br />I do have a problem with lobbying the Chinese government to impose better working conditions. Industrialization/Modernization takes decades. China will get to where we are eventually. Imposing higher standards now will only hurt the very people you want to help.</span>

You&#39;d make a great pimp, explaining how beating the hoes is kosher because &quot;they knew the risks&quot; and hey, it&#39;s better for them in the long run than being flat broke. lol!</span>

And we are not even asking you to stop pimping them out, just suggesting you give them condoms. Oy!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The metaphor really doesn&#39;t work. There&#39;s just too many incongruities. For example, the hoes can&#39;t complain to the police because everything I do is not only legal, but supported by the government. I pay my hoes at least twice as much as any other pimp and the other pimps will treat them just as poorly. I only hire new hoes that have paid a talent agency to screen them. 8,000 would-be-hoes ask me to pimp for them a month.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&gt; &quot;Foxconn rationally thinks that they will lose business if they don&#39;t abuse their employees? Or are they just living out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment</a> like millions of other mid-level sadists throughout history?&quot;<br /><br />So tell me if this is a fair summary of your argument. There&#39;s no good profit-oriented motive for what Foxconn is doing. Further, it can&#39;t be explained as simply the blundering of a large corporation. This is raw sadism - they are so flush with cash and profits, and/or so free of distractions, that they are into giving their employees a few kicks for sport.<br /><br />So let&#39;s grant that that&#39;s 100% true. But surely, if true (the non-profit-driven, abuse-for-abuse&#39;s-sake treatment of employees), this is the tip of the iceberg. Foxconn represents a zillionth of manufacturing activity in China, much of which is devoted to producing lower-margin goods using lower-productivity labor.<br /><br />So can you explain why your moral sense is only activated when high-margin consumer products intended for sale in the US are involved (and what&#39;s more, when they happen to be in the news)?<br /><br /><br />&gt; &quot;Why don&#39;t we just let the Southern states decide what&#39;s best for them as they agriculturalize?&quot; -- Steve&#39;s ancestor in 1860<br /><br />I&#39;ll happily respond to this troll.<br /><br />The rapid industrialization of China and India (and the rest of now-rich Asia before them) is categorically different from the slave trade, namely because companies like Foxconn do not own slaves. This would seem to be a pretty difficult thing for lefties to grok: corporations do mean things but the people who work for them are compelled by economic forces to work for them rather than on account of those people being considered property of those companies by the state.<br /><br />Also there was a war over slavery:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg</a><br /><br />Do we have a human-rights-based cause for war with China?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot; LOL at naïve libertarians drawing imaginary lines between employment and coercion. And sighing at the all-or-nothing false dilemmas sprouting like pimples on the face of a 15-year-old who just read Atlas Shrugged for the first time. I&#39;m not saying Foxconn should shutter IPod City, just that Apple should pressure them to be marginally less sadistic while losing zero market share and maybe 1% of short-term profits. Lord knows the Chinese government won&#39;t.&quot;<br /><br />I think I&#39;d slightly favor the moral concerns of pimply-faced 15-year-old readers of Ayn Rand over middle-aged men who get bent out of shape over iPxx production. The teenagers have some prospect (low odds, but still!) of getting interested in economic history and what it takes to make a business work, and in the tough choices faced by millions of people in poor countries as those countries industrialize. They have a chance of being a little more thoughtful and constructive, and not just worrying-out-loud due to the latest NYT expose.<br /><br />I can&#39;t over-emphasize the in-effect complete moral vacuity of the left on international development. You all have empathy for individuals and that&#39;s admirable, but it&#39;s as if 60 years of economic history is simply unknown to you.<br /><br />To take a small example: why is someone like Norman Borlaug not a hero of the left? Do any of you know who the guy is? Libertarians seem to. It&#39;s as if he, and let&#39;s say the businesses in general, are manufacturing vaccines, and the left is incapable of looking beyond the 1 in a million who dies due to complications of vaccination. And the solutions are offer are on the order of, say, shutting down the clinics where the deceased were administered vaccine - nonsensical, borderline negligent if you consider the side-effects. <br /><br />The conditions of the average worker in China or India will not be meaningfully affected by pressure from Apple or Nike. History tells us that conditions will probably improve as Chinese and Indian people become better educated and richer.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Korea#Third_Republic" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Korea#Third_Republic</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Miracle" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Miracle</a></span>

You and I are ok - given the practical alternatives - with the rule of the Ayatollahs in Iran and Assad in Syria, and even the &quot;Communists&quot; in China. So let&#39;s agree that neither of us likes it when people are badly treated (because saying otherwise would be a completely uninteresting strawman), but also that the cure might be worse than the disease.</span>
