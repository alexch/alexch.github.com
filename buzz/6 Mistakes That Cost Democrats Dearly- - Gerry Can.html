<span class="entry-title entry-content">The elderly is the patron of both parties.<br /><br />It is wrong to let the government intervene in markets.  The government is to set the rules of competition, not to pick the winners.  It&#39;s not there to rob the winners the spoils of competition.  <br /><br />What foreign governments do is between their voters and their government.<br /><br />People voted against bail outs, against TARP, against Obamacare, and against the Recovery Act.  That sounds like a vote for more capitalism to me.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;45% of voters were voting against Obamacare&quot;<br /><br />This says nothing to me.  Obama ran on HCR, talked about it at every campaign stop for two years, and about 45% of the electorate voted against him.  However he won, and made good on what he talked about at every campaign stop.<br /><br />They passed Dole/Romneycare, which I guarantee you these 45% do not understand.  Furthermore I guarantee you that if you laid out the major provisions of the legislation in a poll (I say that because it has been done several times before) people support them individually by large margins.<br /><br />Can we stop pretending the &quot;will of the voters&quot; means much of anything?  Should anyone have cared in 2006 or 1996?  80% of people who voted against the dems have a family member who&#39;s unemployed.  That&#39;s your most important statistic - it&#39;s about as interesting as concluding that you got wet because it rained.<br /><br />&quot;Seventy-four percent described themselves (voters) as dissatisfied or even angry about the way the federal government is working,&quot; <br />&quot;56 percent of voters said government &#39;is doing too many things better left to business and individuals,&quot; vs. 38 percent who said it &quot;should do more to solve problems.&#39;&quot; <br /><br /> --&gt; Let fly a couple questions about what they would cut out of the budget and you&#39;ll get massive majorities going the opposite direction.  It&#39;s trivially easy to design a poll that shows airtight support for significant government programs and spending among Americans.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">This NYT cover story has some pretty good reasons too.<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/us/politics/04campaign.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper" >http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/us/politics/04campaign.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper</a><br />&quot;Democrats Outrun by a 2-Year G.O.P. Comeback Plan&quot;: &quot;The White House struggled to keep Democrats in line, with a misplaced confidence in the power of the coalition that propelled Mr. Obama into office. Republicans capitalized on backlash to the ambitious agenda Mr. Obama and his party pursued, which fueled unrestricted and often anonymous contributions to conservative groups, some advised by a nemesis Democrats thought they had shaken, Karl Rove. That money so strengthened the Republican assault across the country that an exasperated Democratic party strategist likened it to “nuclear Whac-a-Mole.”&quot;<br /><br />Steve, your saying the economy is the main issue is correct, but it&#39;s only part of the story. The other part is how the Democrats were caught flatfooted by false claims they didn&#39;t counter. Otherwise at least some of the angry votes would make the step from &quot;the economy sucks&quot; to &quot;I&#39;ll vote for the party that&#39;s trying to fix it&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll vote for the party that gave me that tax cut&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll vote for the party who paid for that bridge repair that gave my cousin a job&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll vote for the party that&#39;s trying to reduce the deficit instead of just talking about it&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll vote for the guy who&#39;s not a complete pussy and maybe <b>he&#39;ll</b> get the job done.&quot;.<br /><br />@James, unemployment did rise in 2008 but it&#39;s been holding steady at around 9.5% for over a year now. Obama stopped the bleeding but couldn&#39;t heal the wound. (Hence Gerry&#39;s reason #0.) <a href="http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?request_action=wh&amp;graph_name=LN_cpsbref3" >http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?request_action=wh&amp;graph_name=LN_cpsbref3</a><br /><br />@Kevin, &quot;Corporations are supposed to go out of business when they can&#39;t compete.&quot; is not a hard fact, it&#39;s a preference. We have a heavily subsidized capitalism here in the US, and many businesses remain afloat that &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; according to hard nosed free market ideology. While I agree that <b>not</b> letting GM fail was a disappointment for libertarians, it&#39;s also true that <b>not</b> pushing for the public option or single payer was a disappointment for progressives, and neither one was a categorical imperative. <br /><br />And bailing out GM was totally the right thing to do. There is a direct causal line between the government bailout of GM and  the all-important unemployment rate (not to mention the future of American industry). And btw the government is poised to make a profit on its bailout investment, so it was also a smart capitalist move. In VC terms the government was GM&#39;s &quot;white knight&quot;. <br /><br />This is part of what burns me up about the messaging war (Steve, go grab your blankie): Democrats are totally walking the capitalist walk and they&#39;re being called socialists. Republicans are calling for plutocracy and theocracy and they&#39;re the ones who get the capitalist street cred. If there were a viable radical left wing then people might see Democrats for the centrists they truly are (the Overton Window argument).</span>

The current situation matters but so does the delta.<br /><br />Hypothetical question: If the unemployment curve had started to bend down a year ago, instead of 6 months ago, would that have been something Obama could have effectively taken credit for?

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Alex &quot;Corporations are supposed to go out of business when they can&#39;t compete&quot; is not my opinion of how capitalism should function, that&#39;s the definition of how it should function.  In China, Russia and South Korea, the government proudly supports their favored corporations at the expense of would-be competitors.  It&#39;s not capitalism anymore, it&#39;s statism.  That&#39;s not walking the capitalist walk.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want my government being compared to a VC.  We&#39;re going to have to disagree bailing out GM.  Neither of us truly know what would have happened.<br /><br />@Steve The poll results combined with the election results paint a pretty good picture on what the voters were thinking on Tuesday.  Two years ago, the voters thought something else.  Two years from now, I suspect that they&#39;ll be voting on different issues too.<br /><br />Each election has a different set of voters too, which is also why the poll numbers change.</span>

I chose the impossible. I chose...

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@James I think you should limit your attacks to things I actually said, in the context of the conversation, rather than daring me to to find a place in the world that practices pure capitalism.  That&#39;s something I never claimed.<br /><br />Private ownership of the means of production, creation of goods or services for profit in a market, and prices and wages are elements of capitalism.<br /><br />There is also a vast difference between societies that practice capitalism and pure capitalism.  There is a difference between providing incentives, encouraging other companies to purchase a company, and providing loans to businesses and buying one.  You can do the former in a capitalistic society, but the latter is out of bounds.  Please note, I&#39;m did not complain about Chrysler in this thread.<br /><br />You will never find a time in American history where the federal government owned and operated a Fortune 500 business other than this time.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Kevin, your general argument, and the entire libertarian movement, would have much more credibility if criticisms of govt intervention were made in the context of a full accounting of history and the real choices at hand.<br /><br />It is a fact that a quirk of our American system is that companies are the ones that pay for things like health insurance.<br /><br />And health insurance is extremely expensive.<br /><br />And companies promised retirement benefits of a certain level to their employees a long time ago.<br /><br />And there&#39;s no govt replacement for those benefits.<br /><br />Now they&#39;re old, and if the company goes under it&#39;s the govt that takes on this burden.  These people vote, and there&#39;s a bit of a moral obligation involved when the govt expects companies to provide for workers, but then big companies go under.  You can excuse us fallible humans for not incorporating things like bankruptcy of major corporations into our planning for the future.  This is not something humans are good at doing - proven in behavioral economics and cognitive psychology studies.<br /><br />So then when we get the Reason-y libertarian JUDGEMENT, a kind of autistic view on reality, human nature, etc, intent on proving that all you need is some (mostly misunderstood) econ 101 and a little bit of Mises and Rand and Hayek to explain all of life, in all it&#39;s complexity and gray and hypocrisy and inconsistency, yes you end up not communicating.<br /><br />Of course it&#39;s the case that if you let GM go bankrupt then Honda makes better cars and consumers benefit and ......... boring.  Everyone, including in the Obama administration, generally agrees on this here in 2010.  There is simply more to the story than that.  There is complexity.  Public policy.  Cost benefit analysis, and (at the time) a crisis at hand.  Are these things all zeroed out in your estimation of things?  Is this simply an opportunity to educate the world on the virtues of markets?  Dude, we got it.  There are other problems to address too.  In the grand scheme of things - bank bailouts and such - the GM bailout is just not a big deal.  Capitalism will go on being an important force (one among many) in people&#39;s lives, in shaping where/how things are made, etc.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Alex You&#39;re going to reward Steve for dismissing an argument because it&#39;s boring?  Never mind that I never said that anyone would make better cars.  I&#39;ll admit, I was not prepared for that one.  I feel like a jury member right after hearing Johnny Cochran&#39;s Chewbacca defense.  Maybe you did too?  That&#39;s why you so quickly declared Steve the winner?  We&#39;re having fun here....<br /><br />@Steve &quot;And health insurance is extremely expensive.&quot;  Agree.<br /><br />&quot;And companies promised retirement benefits of a certain level to their employees a long time ago.&quot;  Agree.<br /><br />&quot;And there&#39;s no govt replacement for those benefits.&quot;  Not sure about that one.  Why would Medicare not apply?  Was Obama that pessimistic about his healthcare bill passing?<br /><br />There seems to be this assumption that every single employee would have lost his job along with his union benefits.  I disagree.  Some job loss was inevitable either way, many factories were closed after the government took over, but I suspect that the profitable operations within GM would have remained operational, under the umbrella of a new corporation.  Those employees would have remained unionized and able to negotiate for healthcare.<br /><br />If you really want to look at the big picture, you have to consider what wiping out GM&#39;s bond holders did.  It wasn&#39;t just fat cats and hedge funds.  Also hard hit were the pension funds for public employees, the retirement funds for teachers, police officers and firemen.  Did you include that on your balance sheet?<br /><br />I don&#39;t think attacking Reason or the fact that I read it was necessary.  Much of my opinion on this issue was formed after reading Ian Bremmer&#39;s, &quot;The End of the Free Market.&quot;  I read a lot of things with lots of different political leanings.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to dismiss an argument until you understand it.  I probably don&#39;t live up to that standard all the time, but I do this time.<br /><br />No, it&#39;s not a just a teachable moment about the virtues of the market.  It should have been a teachable moment to stockholders and management that they&#39;ll be held accountable for their bad decisions.   It should have been a teachable moment that the contract you enter as a bondholder is upheld during liquidation and that political favorites don&#39;t get to jump ahead of you the line of asset distributions.<br /><br />It should have been a teachable lesson that just because the head of the union is good friends with the president that the union doesn&#39;t get special treatment.  It should have been a teachable lesson that political donations only go so far.<br /><br />Instead, we&#39;ll end up wondering if the government would have purchased GM if the UAW didn&#39;t have a long, close relationship with the Democrats.  Would the UAW been given the chance to buy shares in GM for pennies on the dollars if Gettelfinger, head of the UAW, wasn&#39;t friends with Obama?<br /><br />Perhaps all of Bush&#39;s sweetheart deals with Haliburton was a teachable moment for Obama.  Anything is possible if you use the magical phrase, &quot;national security.&quot;<br /><br />BTW, if you spotted the phrase that took James and I into a tailspin, please share it.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">“There is a difference,” Sir John said coolly, “ between prejudice and principles.”<br />    “Yes,” Joyce replied. “Other people have prejudices; but I have principles. Just as other people are stubborn but I am firm, other people are egotists but I merely have self-respect, other people are drunks but I only like a drop now and then. Shall I conjugate a few more phrases like that? Other people are peculiar, but I am exotic. Other people are naïve and gullible, but I have retained a certain childish innocence. Other people are too clever by half, but I have learned to express myself with elegance. Other people are sensualists, but I am a Romantic. Other people are paranoid, but I am merely careful. Other people are pigheaded fools, but I am merely a little set in my ways.”</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">People who vote Republican are, on average, most certainly not voting for capitalism.  First you would have to understand what capitalism is.  Then you&#39;d need to be able to mentally separate being pro-capitalism from being pro-business.  Republicans are pro-business.<br /><br />There isn&#39;t much difference between the major American political parties on capitalism, nor has there ever been, really.</span>
