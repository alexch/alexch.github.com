<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1233/5100833139_5d79be3785_o.jpg" alt="Last Tuesday I ordered a few things from Amazon. Most of the items were shipped via UPS and arrived on Thursday night. 

One of the items was shipped via FedEx.

On Thursday, I was at home at 3:15 when the FedEx guy put a sticker on my door and left without ringing the bell.

On Friday, I was at home at 3:19 when the FedEx guy put a sticker on my door and left without ringing the bell.

On Monday, I printed up the following note:

&amp;quot;Dear Fedex - We are home. Honest. Please don&amp;#39;t just leave a sticker and run away like you did on Thursday and Friday. We miss you!&amp;quot;

Okay, it might have been a tiny bit snarky, but I thought it was pretty friendly and at least very clear. It even had my cell phone number on it in case he rang the bell and there was no answer. I taped the two previous door tags to it and put in on my door.

A little after 3:00 on Monday, I was out getting lunch, but I saw a FedEx truck cruise down 19th St. and raced back to meet it. I called Roommate #1, who was working at home, to let him know the van was coming, so turn off the music and listen up. I found out later that Roommate #2 was also home, taking a late lunch break; his window looks out over the doorway and the doorbell rings directly outside his room.

At 3:16, the FedEx dude put a sticker *on the note I left for him* and left without ringing the bell.

To repeat: There was a note that asked him not to leave a sticker and run away... and he stuck the sticker on that very note. And then ran away.

I called the 800 number and filed a report, and when I finally got a ride to pick up the package at the depot tonight, the guy behind the counter was very interested in my story and took the page from me and promised he&amp;#39;d take action.  I hope this jerk gets what&amp;#39;s coming to him.

But actually, what I really want is to just somehow get to look him in the eye as he answers this simple question:

&amp;quot;WTF?&amp;quot;
