<span class="entry-title entry-content">The reality is that many many people are going to vote R next month (or have already) because they think Obama raised, and will continue to raise, their taxes. And Obama and the Dems have encouraged this false belief by their incompetence at marketing/communications/politics. So this is indeed a case where reality (a Republican majority in the House) will have been caused by people saying, and not saying, words (&quot;tax and spend&quot; and &quot;Obama Tax Cuts&quot; respectively said and not said). Proof by example of my underlying theory.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">They&#39;re voting for the Republicans because they see the amount of spending that hasn&#39;t been paid for and believe that the spending represents future taxes.  It&#39;s not the tax hikes, or lack of, that have already occurred.  They&#39;re voting for Republicans because the economy still stinks, despite all the money that has been spent.<br /><br />Those two reasons, and the second is probably a bigger factor than the first, is why Republicans will be gaining votes.<br /><br />P.S.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Yeah, I agree that those are the reasons, but those voters&#39; logic is wrong. <br /><br />If the Democrats had spent more in the stimulus then the economy would be better, and if they had done a better job of explaining, &quot;OK, <b>first</b> we do this huge stimulus to get the economy rolling, and <b>then</b> we reduce the deficit, and btw we&#39;re the only party who actually ever <b>does</b> reduce the deficit when we say we will&quot; then they&#39;d have more support. Instead they kind of mumbled that message and then ran away, and let the Republicans define the terms of debate.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Voters are dumb and all those reasons are bullshit<br /><br />Clinton had a great economy and was a mediocre president at best.<br /><br />Everyone thinks the President can do magical things and actually <b>cause</b> economies grow / get better.  Even though they are proven wrong every four years.<br /><br />Even worse, people think politicians will solve the big problems and fulfill starry-eyed expectations.  Rather than simply govern pretty well and not screw too many things up.<br /><br />Though this time they&#39;re seriously threatening to give control to crazy knuckle-draggers.  The leaders of this party want to repeal the HCR mandate and keep the benefits, for example - that&#39;s really what Boehner and McConnell say, and all indications are that they understand not the FIRST thing about wtf they are talking about.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to Pelosi and Obama for &#39;08-&#39;10, for being so awesome.  Not that it couldn&#39;t have been improved!  It could!  But let&#39;s not judge them against some ahistorical ideal of what pols can get done.  Also let&#39;s remember that if the economy were good this conversation would be completely inverted (and that would be dumb too).</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&gt; Also let&#39;s remember that if the economy were good this conversation would be completely inverted (and that would be dumb too).<br /><br />Correct. But that&#39;s politics. That&#39;s why we smart liberals were advocating for the stimulus to be $1.5T, all in spending. (In voter math, big == big; you max out on outrage at about $100B these days, so all higher numbers are free.) But then Obama&#39;s <b>opening bid</b> was only $800B IIRC, a good portion of which were tax cuts (one of the least stimulative forms of deficit spending). So we though, OK, well, at least he&#39;ll get some political points for the tax cuts. But then he never even mentioned it! And he wasn&#39;t able to effectively take credit for the 2 point whatever million jobs saved or gained either. <br /><br />Of course politics is dumb, but it&#39;s necessary. And Obama and Pelosi and &quot;Mumbles&quot; Reid totally failed at it this cycle. I mean, yay for Lily Ledbetter, but what does it matter if now nothing happens for the next 2 years?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Is that a non sequitir? There&#39;s a difference between QE (aka &quot;printing money&quot;) and deficit spending, right? <br /><br />I&#39;m talking about the stimulus, aka the ARRA (<a href="http://www.recovery.gov" >http://www.recovery.gov</a>), not Fed money policy, so I can only assume you&#39;ve just awakened from a terrible nightmare about the Fed and haven&#39;t quite shaken the cobwebs off yet.<br /><br />And IANAE but Paul Krugman has a cute beard so I support whatever he says.<br /><br />And anyway I&#39;m not even talking about economics: my main point is that Obama has been horrible at taking credit for things like, giving huge tax cuts and not being a Muslim and being against gay marriage and all the things he thought would make Republicans like him after they were so mean that whole time. Whatever the policy, the optics have sucked, and optics wins elections.</span>
