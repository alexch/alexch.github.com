<span class="entry-title entry-content">I really wish they would ban Tasers.  They horribly desensitize cops to the use of force.  Kid runs onto a baseball field - tase him.  Person not cooperating fast enough for the cop&#39;s taste - tase him.  The bar to using &quot;force&quot; SHOULD be high for police.  They are not the courts and use of force should only be acceptable in the most extreme circumstances.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Heh, Having shot many guns and having handled a taser gun, I do not understand how anyone could mistake one for the other.  The situation was pretty calm when he shot the kid too.<br /><br />Yeah, tasers are used way too often.  Peaceful noncompliance shouldn&#39;t get you tased.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">So, I was robbed at gunpoint in Bayview before.  And after I gave the guy everything I had without any resistance?  He was nice enough to slap me across the face with his handgun before calling me &quot;faggot&quot; and walking off.<br /><br />These people are animals with little to no regard for public safety or just the simple rights of humans to live in peace.  <br /><br />Cops are in a weird position - they are sensationalized by the media as power-hungry oppressors of human rights on one end, and then called completely useless when the law restricts them on the other.  And within that context, they have to - on a daily basis - deal with the same type of animals on the streets.  Animals who wouldn&#39;t blink twice before shooting the cop.  So, I can definitely imagine how and why Mehserle lost his cool and shot the FELON (let&#39;s not forget that part) who was resisting arrest.<br /><br />Now, I definitely feel that Mehserle acted negligently and had no real reason to shoot the guy in the manner he did.  He definitely got the conviction that he deserved - involuntary manslaughter.  <br /><br />Murder?  No.  He clearly did not wake up that morning and plan to kill someone on BART.  At least, that wasn&#39;t proven.  In addition, he was under a level of stress that could understandably make him overreact and use his firearm. That separates involuntary from voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br />IMHO, he got the right conviction at the right level.  He was definitely wrong, but his heart wasn&#39;t a hole of pure evil like the media and the animals are making it out to be.<br /><br />(just to be crystal clear - when I say &quot;animals&quot; I am referring to anyone who feels they are not obligated to follow society&#39;s laws and do as they please without regard to human life and safety.  This has nothing to do with race)</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I have also been robbed at gunpoint, and it is not a nice feeling, but I have more distaste for over-aggressive police than I do for that guy who threatened my life. At least with the criminal I can believe he&#39;s someone at the minimum out of control, perhaps mentally ill or drugged up. Police who tase people are often immature bullies. And the state sanctioning them makes the situation even worse.<br /><br />As mentioned in the article, it&#39;s a &quot;means of intimidation&quot; that causes pain and often humiliation and doesn&#39;t make crime any less likely to happen. It&#39;s also WAY too easy to use and, unlike a gun, leaves no marks. I think it&#39;s fucking bullshit, to be honest, and should be illegal. It&#39;s certainly cruel and I would like every taser banned across the country. <br /><br />And with regard to Michael&#39;s comment, do you think the police tasering someone never call them &quot;faggot&quot; also? It sounds like you wish others to have the same bad experience as you, but this time at the hands of the police, which is something you should reconsider. There are many police officers who are &quot;animals&quot; just as much as your robber, and have an itchy trigger finger just waiting to take out their frustrations on the next sucker who happens to come along.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I&#39;m not sure I have any real opinion on whether police should use taser guns.  You give anyone a weapon, and they&#39;ll be misused.  I mean, humans are humans.  With all the potential emotional baggage they&#39;re carrying around.  At least with tasers, an abuse of the weapon would generally not lead to death (notwithstanding a dumbass who went for his gun vs. taser).<br /><br />No, I don&#39;t want ANYONE to have the same experience I did.  And no, I&#39;m not seeking revenge (which I think is what you were alluding to?).  I was using that as an example of some of the street-level bullshit cops have to deal with, while being constrained (properly, or improperly so).  Oh yeah, and in areas like Bayview or Oakland, you also run a higher risk than usual of being shot, simply for being a cop.<br /><br />Again, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right.  But one has to take that stress level under consideration before jumping on the &quot;all cops are corrupt&quot; bandwagon.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I don&#39;t watch the 6 o&#39;clock news, and of course it&#39;s my opinion. Don&#39;t tase me, bro! :p<br /><br />Famous taser quotes aside, when a police department authorizes its officers to use tasers on passive subjects who simply refuse to obey a verbal command -- and there are quite a few, don&#39;t know the exact number -- I think it&#39;s institutionalized bullying. The violence and causing pain become routine practice. Tasers allow the police to intimidate, humiliate, and degrade people and I think it&#39;s wrong.<br /><br />And cops who resort to tasering instead of taking the time and patience (or calling in the backup) required to sort out a situation -- yeah, I think they&#39;re immature. Their job is to maintain law and order, not bag and tag any person that comes in their radius and won&#39;t obey. <br /><br />And you&#39;re right, humans are humans. They will misuse weapons and power in general. Tasers were introduced to stop people who are running away and dangerous, to be used instead of a gun. But they are like cop iPods that have a &#39;TORTURE&#39; button.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Been out of the loop for a few days with family in town - but just to add my two cents to this line of thought which has clearly been completed...given the last posting was on July 10th...<br /><br />I have been the subject to two horrific actions against my personal freedom and property as well, but that is irrelevant to this line of argument.  It only calls into suspicion the line of thought of the individual.  I only bring it up to say that I understand the consequences of criminal action against individuals.  That aside...<br /><br />The force a criminal uses against their victims is not an issue in this line of thought.  They may be dangerous.  They may be out of control.  And if such actions are excessive, police have weapons at their disposal.  As I argued before, the hurdle for the use of force by the police SHOULD be high.  Police are the arm of the state that acts to bring citizens to the justice of said state.  They ARE in a very difficult position as Michael alluded to.  The fact is that no matter what the situation is - the police are dealing with someone who has NEVER been convicted of the crime for which they are being pursued unless the person of interest was convicted in absentia.  Under such circumstances, the use of any force in that situation is a non-judicially sanctioned action against that individual.  A person who forces the police to resort to such violence do so b/c their actions threaten the police themselves or other citizens and such criminals have forced the issue to extremes.  <br /><br />The individual in this particular case was not innocent of prior actions, but were his actions worthy of a death sentence?  By lowering the bar of &quot;police action&quot; the individual was deprived of life by the state simply for being a bit of a dick.  That is unacceptable.<br /><br />On the police side of the issue, the adversarial position of the police with citizens is bad enough as it is.  There are arguments that the current police v. citizen relationship is the natural result of Miranda but i really don&#39;t care about that one way or another for the purposes of this discussion.  Police need to work within the community (much like the lessons learned by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan).  Giving the police ANY additional weapons (short of their fists or batons) that they can use against an unarmed citizen is not something I&#39;m comfortable with.  The consequences are a police force that has a dangerous weapon (see Kevin&#39;s link) that they view as an option in very simple or slightly aggravated situations.  Tasers are mocked in movies (see the Hangover...you tube &quot;In the Face!&quot; for an example) and the average person and cop loses respect for the weapon.  Say what you will about the NRA but one of their core ideals is that you treat a rifle/pistol with respect as if it could go off at any time.  We don&#39;t have that with tasers and they can kill people (IBID).<br /><br />Police are still just humans.  They have a difficult and often thankless job to do.  The reality is that they often do little to PREVENT crime other then preventing the NEXT crime by catching the individual citizens who would harm others.  Tasers minimize and desensitize police to the actions that they are taking. Not all - but enough that it is an issue.<br /> <br />Been drinking beer.  Beer gone.  Must get more.</span>
