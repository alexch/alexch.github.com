<span class="entry-title entry-content">Haha, yes Nick I&#39;m serious though my brevity may have been evaluated at an extreme. I&#39;m fine with someone believing something (I believe Chipotle is the best chain restaurant out there), but I&#39;m not comfortable with someone who&#39;s inflexible about their beliefs (I don&#39;t always eat at Chipotle, and I&#39;m willing to accommodate other&#39;s interests). <br /><br />Unfortunately, in politics, what we&#39;d normally consider &#39;common sense&#39; or &#39;compromising&#39; gets considered &#39;wishy washy&#39; and someone with &#39;political steadfast beliefs&#39; would be called &#39;stubborn&#39; in normal society.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I figured I might be reading into your comment overly much, but still it&#39;s interesting to evaluate it as written. I mean, the world <b>is</b> actually based on absolutes, like the speed of light. The rules of gravity that keep us in an orbit perfect for sustaining life also make Lagrange points, where things could look stuck or balanced depending on your attitude.<br /><br />One thing in negotiating that is pretty close to an absolute is that if you start from a position that&#39;s short of what you want, the other side is not going to fix it for you. That&#39;s not wishy washy or stubborn, it&#39;s just stupid -- and that&#39;s what Obama seems to always do (and what I always seem to post in shared items by Steve or Alex).</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">There&#39;s a difference between pragmatism and craven compromise. What baffles and frustrates me is that in so many of these compromises the most effective and pragmatic solutions are watered down to satisfy the stubborn, ideological purity of the right.<br /><br />E.g. the stimulus should have been $1T+, with no tax cuts. Instead it was $700B with 40% tax cuts. And now the Democrats have trouble saying it was a success, since the economy still sucks. There was a great segment about this on Rachel Maddow the other day; let me see if I can find it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#38601949" >http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#38601949</a><br /><br />And yes Kevin, I agree that Obama is POTUSed.</span>

There&#39;s only everything he&#39;s ever written about himself, and all the in-depth profiles ever written about him, that explain this.  And then wall-to-wall coverage of the 2008 campaign for like a year straight.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Alex, no disagreement that there&#39;s a &quot;difference between pragmatism and craven compromise&quot; and I was really trying to make a statement sans commenting on the political situation.<br /><br />@Nick - &quot;the world is actually based on absolutes&quot; I have to tell you that made me laugh so much. I recall arguing for many hours in college w/ a girl about my statement &quot;cake is just sugar, flour and milk&quot;...<br /><br />I like your example Re: speed of light, but I tend to read &#39;is&#39; in a similar vein as the term &#39;or&#39; in philosophical and digital logic. I.e. in those fields &quot;both&quot; is an acceptable answer to the statement &quot;you can have cake or ice cream for dessert&quot; (where as in real English it&#39;s meant as &#39;exclusive or (xor)&#39;).<br /><br />Perhaps I believe &#39;is&#39; functions rarely as an absolute because I have a somewhat eastern (vs. western philosophy), by which I mean that in Eastern philosophy the presumption is that things are defined by what they&#39;re not. <br /><br />For example, when making a statement such as &quot;He is fast.&quot; (relative to what and whom?). Or even with your example, rules of gravity are rules until someone finds out they don&#39;t apply in quantum theory... <br /><br /><br />Anyway, I was just trying to make an observation about the dangers of absolutes and convenient labels. Sometimes they&#39;re necessary, e.g. your absolutely correct example about negotiating from a compromise won&#39;t yield anything but further compromise. Sometimes they&#39;re not.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Money quote from the Maddow clip (but you should really watch the whole 10 minutes) &quot;republicans and conservatives fought to get tens of billions of dollars of money for states taken out of the stimulus package in order to try to get conservative votes. democrats gave up what would have actually made the economy better and now we are paying the price for it. democrats watered down the stimulus. they literally made it less stimulative. they made it less effective. the result is that they are still getting nailed for having spent all that money on the stimulus, but the stimulus isn&#39;t actually doing as much as it should. they&#39;re getting nailed again for not having much to show for what they spent. they get hit for spending the money and they get hit for the fact that it didn&#39;t have the necessary effect.&quot;<br /><br />Steve, again: we&#39;re not <b>confused</b>, we&#39;re <b>disappointed</b>.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">That is fun that you brought up Eastern philosophy, because Obama doesn&#39;t follow the golden rule, but constantly violates the silver rule; he has a very clear idea in his mind about the kind of president he doesn&#39;t want to be, and puts that before everything else; and the grand total of people in the country who support his entire set of actions &amp; policies is exactly zero, including him.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Please keep watching! I promise to sit through the next 10-minute rant you link to :-)<br /><br />Rachel&#39;s style, especially in her opening segments, is pedagogical. She starts in kindergarten and ends in grad school (her own metaphor). She was making a broad point about public sector jobs, temporary or not, and your point is examined in the followup interview:<br /><br />&gt;&gt; what do you think this latest jobs report would have looked like had the stimulus been more focused on aid to local and state governments?<br /><br />&gt;&gt; it probably would have looked a bit better. one thing we should say, the big hit in the jobs report wasn&#39;t just state and local jobs. i think we lost some 40,000 normal government jobs. it was census jobs, right? 140,000 of those expired. this is a very important point because a job is a job is a job is a job. if you ask a firefighter or even a temporary census worker are you employed, they don&#39;t say i&#39;m employed by the government. they say i am employed.<br /><br />So since the fact that most of the jobs lost were census jobs doesn&#39;t affect her main point, it was OK to drop it. (I think that the census thing makes a different point, which is that the MSM talking heads should have mentioned it more.) And it actually reinforces a different point she made in her conclusion:<br /><br />here&#39;s how matt eglasias put it today. the losses came from the public sector, and they were foreseeable. they were foreseen by the president of the united states and the speaker of the house of representatives and the majority leader of the united states senate and the majority of house members and a majority of senators. but because in the senate a minority of members can get their way, action wasn&#39;t taken. consequently, we have a horrible jobs number. which would be bad enough, but the way the american political system works, the minority party that prevented the majority from addressing the crisis will accrue massive political benefits as a result of the collapse.<br /> <br />Census jobs, since they&#39;re temporary, are very forseeable -- yet the Republicans were OK with not filling a huge 140K pothole they could all see coming down the road for the past 2+ years.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The census workers had to be laid off.  The infrastructure to hire them to in to other positions just wasn&#39;t there.  Sure, they knew it those temporary workers would be coming off employment, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that there&#39;s no where to go.  We&#39;re better off just paying unemployment benefits than winding up bureaucracies that are extremely difficult to wind down.<br /><br />There&#39;s also the thought that public spending can squeeze out private investing.  Robert Byrd&#39;s career has shed some light on that recently.  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704111704575354870221777334.html" >http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704111704575354870221777334.html</a></span>
