<span class="entry-title entry-content">You&#39;re less likely to use your own money to say something if it means the guy you disagree with is going to get money from the government to counter your efforts.  On the other end, it places incentives on waiting for your opponent to spend his own money so you can spend the government&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty clear that it squashes speech that other wise would have occurred had the law not been in place.  It was a good decision.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Nonsense. It doesn&#39;t squash anything. If rich people choose not to spend because they don&#39;t think it will allow them an advantage, that&#39;s their choice not to spend. &quot;Less likely to use your own money&quot; is not a violation of free speech. They argued their First Amendment rights were violated, and no such thing happened. <br /><br />It&#39;s just so wrong in many ways. The idea that these people&#39;s speech is &quot;burdened&quot; by the presence of the speech of others is complete garbage, and to rule that the &quot;burden&quot; exists &quot;without serving a compelling state interest&quot; is totally wrong as well. Elections should be decided by the quality of the candidates and their ideas, not by their ability to fund them, and &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; is this way is very much in the interest of the state and quite compelling -- not only is it more democratic, it discourages corruption. It&#39;s great for our country to dissuade rich citizens from thinking they can get a decisive advantage in an election purely with spending power, and relieving candidates of having to make private promises to enact legislation purely to obtain campaign money is good, too.<br /><br />Terrible, awful, bad decision. It&#39;s like rich people suing that public housing is unconstitutional because they spent so much money on their own house and it violates their rights that every time they add a wing to their house, the poor people get one added to theirs, too. Bullshit!</span>

With matching funds, you get indirect regulation of speech.<br /><br />You cite corruption as motivation, but just as bothersome is a political faction determining which speech gets matching funds and which doesn&#39;t in order to stay in power.<br /><br />APPLESAUCE!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">On the surface, it doesn&#39;t interfere with the right to free speech.<br /><br />But the problem is that because person A has incentives not to speak because he knows that person B will get to speak using someone else&#39;s money. That speech is the abridged speech in  &quot;Congress shall make no law....abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;  That&#39;s the speech that won&#39;t occur.  That&#39;s the political discussion that won&#39;t happen.  The incentives are set up so you wait for your opponent to exercise his right so you can do it at the taxpayers&#39; expense.<br /><br />Fiddlesticks!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;Incentives not to speak&quot;, eh...piffle. Your argument has more holes than swiss cheese and smells worse than limburger. There&#39;s bigger things happening here than some little crappy rich Arizonan&#39;s desire to purchase an election:<br /><br />&quot;The First Amendment’s core purpose is to foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of ro- bust discussion and debate. Nothing in Arizona’s anti- corruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, violates this constitutional protection. To the con- trary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the First Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhanc- ing the “opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.”<br /><br />Promotion of values, get it? In other words, let the people hear both sides, not just you because you spent more money. The point of electing an official is to get &quot;honest government, working on behalf of all the people&quot;. And the the First Amendment was not intended to be used to enforce a plutocracy, as it&#39;s being used here. Do you even realize that&#39;s what you&#39;re arguing in favor of?<br /><br />I&#39;d read the whole dissent, if you haven&#39;t already. It pwns not only your argument, but a bunch more. I had no idea Kagan was this clear a thinker &amp; writer -- good stuff.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;The First Amendment’s core purpose is to foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate.&quot;<br /><br />The AZ law does just the opposite.  It discourages speech.  There won&#39;t be as many two sided arguments to hear.  There won&#39;t even be as many one sided arguments to hear.  Sure, when someone feels strongly enough to allow his own money to be countered with tax payer funds, the discussion will be two-sided, but overall number of political discussions will have decreased.<br /><br />The point of the law actually undermines electing &quot;honest government, working on behalf of all the people.&quot;  The dishonest politician is now free to combat the truth with the public&#39;s money, money that he might not have access to.<br /><br />The first amendment was only intended to keep the government from interfering with speech that would naturally occur.  The AZ law diminishes the amount of speech that would naturally occur and was rightly found unconstitutional.<br /><br />You can claim that there are holes in my argument, but I didn&#39;t see a reason for the same amount speech occurring.<br /><br />Kagan&#39;s argument p0wn3d nothing as my argument is the same as winning one, which is now effectively the law of the land.  #WINNING<br /><br />BLATHERSKITE!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Well, you repeat you think &quot;it discourages speech&quot;, but Kagan addresses this quite clearly, as First Amendment law is about making distinctions &quot;between speech restrictions and speech subsidies, and ... between discriminatory and neutral government action...The Arizona Clean Elections Act...grants a non-discriminatory speech subsidy.&quot;<br /><br />See? To violate the First Amendment, there&#39;d need to be a restriction or discrimination. In this case all there is a rich Arizonan with his panties in a bunch because he&#39;s not alone in spending money. You, sir, have been pwnt so thoroughly that you are eligible for a discount at <a href="http://kyjellynowplease.com" >kyjellynowplease.com</a>.<br /><br />Really, I find it shocking that you would agree when these awful, disgusting, anti-democratic, un-American, elitist, oligarch-supporting members of the majority say, &quot;The privately financed candidate must “shoulder a special and potentially significant burden” when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy.&quot; This is complete bullshit, dude!! This amendment is not there to enable someone to spend money on a campaign alone, as if in a vacuum, pretending it has no effect on the community or public sphere.<br /><br />So in summary, it&#39;s only Thursday but so far this week you failed to show any speech being restricted, you failed to read the dissent, you failed to understand the Constitution, you failed to grasp the entire history of corporate finance reform, and you made Theodore Roosevelt&#39;s ghost cry.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Alex That&#39;s ironic with some truth in it.  I like it.  You could probably also add something about waging war to that.<br /><br />@Nick When deciding if a law is constitutional or not, it doesn&#39;t matter who is for the law and who is against.  It&#39;s the law vs. the constitution ( with it&#39;s associated jurisprudence).<br /><br />I explained how speech would be curtailed and how it would deprive society of some political discourse.<br /><br />&quot;This amendment is not there to enable someone to spend money on a campaign alone, as if in a vacuum, pretending it has no effect on the community or public sphere.&quot;<br /><br />Is that a pro-censorship argument you&#39;re making?  It sure looks like one.<br /><br />Did you read the majority decision for the case?  If not, it&#39;s<br /><br />codswallop!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Sure, law vs. Constitution and associated jurisprudence, which was mentioned above and you did not respond. &quot;The Arizona Clean Elections Act...grants a non-discriminatory speech subsidy.&quot; Good luck showing the discrimination and restriction in that.<br /><br />I would hope on further reflection you can see that speech &quot;curtailed&quot; is all in your imagination. In reality, the private spender is free to spend and speak -- unlimited, not restricted, not curtailed, not stopped, not discouraged. There&#39;s simply a consequence to that speech that the gov&#39;t may give some money to another party to produce more speech. <br /><br />Nobody has a right to their speech not generating consequences and pre-emptive squelching of that, as I hope you&#39;ll agree. &quot;But if I speak, someone will respond to that and speak...against me!&quot; is not a viable position for suing your rights have been violated.<br /><br />And pro-censorship? Absolutely not. Nobody censored, though I like how you switched gears in futile hope of finding a way to win.<br /><br />Yes, I did read the majority decision (and if you read it, you&#39;ll notice I quoted from it above). It was a bunch of hooey, baloney and bunkum.<br /><br />This is fun. You are utterly defeated!! Thanks for being such a nice foil.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;In reality, the private spender is free to spend and speak -- unlimited, not restricted, not curtailed, not stopped, not discouraged.&quot;<br /><br />Imagine that you are against issue X.  You decide that in order to raise your side of the issue, you need an advertising campaign.  You are also a person of average means, so you&#39;ll need to raise some funds, by asking for donations, in order to pull the campaign off.  It&#39;s going to be a lot of work to get the funding you need, but it&#39;s doable.<br /><br />The minority in the court believes that you&#39;re just as likely to do that work, knowing that your opponent will get that same amount of money, for free, because you were successful in raising funds, so he can counter your campaign as if your opponent had to raise those funds himself.  It is an absurd assumption.<br /><br />&quot;And pro-censorship? Absolutely not. Nobody censored, though I like how you switched gears in futile hope of finding a way to win.&quot;<br /><br />I didn&#39;t switch gears for a win.  This whole discussion is about the consequences of publicly funding speech to counter private speech.<br /><br />And there is no winning in a political discussion on the interwebz.  Minds will not be changed.  The best you can hope for is that the other side better understands the other side of the argument.  In that regard, you did win.  I don&#39;t think this discussion had any impact on how you saw the other side of the argument.<br /><br />&quot;This is fun. You are utterly defeated!! Thanks for being such a nice foil&quot;<br /><br />Put a notch on the wall and enjoy!  I&#39;ll enjoy the actual supreme court win.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">It&#39;s not absurd at all, and really, it&#39;s not for me or you to tell the people of Arizona what they should fund or not. Laws like this in Arizona exist in part because of the AZSCAM scandal, where they found a lot of elected officials in the state were corrupt. Did you think they just made this law up for fun? The are trying in some small way to have a cleaner electoral process. Money has been a terrible corrupting influence there. <br /><br />Anyway, although you remain unconvinced, it is fun to discuss and you are a good sport. It is interesting to hear about your notion of fairness and to see the ways in which you avoid discussing the decision in the terms presented to you -- for example, your refusal to show any evidence of restriction of speech, or even use that term in your replies. <br /><br />And your connecting the idea that speech &quot;incentives&quot; and fundraising &quot;success&quot; are somehow bound to speech rights -- wow. In your world, it seems raising/having/spending private money entitles one to a sort of immunity from the competition of public spending because the work done raising/acquiring the money entitles you to do it while the others are on some sort of free ride and therefore don&#39;t deserve it. Fascinating! <br /><br />Perhaps if the publicly funded candidates did some sort of community service or hard work equivalent to the number of hours the private spender did fundraising, they would then be allowed in your mind to receive and spend the funds? What if the private spender is simply rich and inherited the money spent? Or is the government not allowed in any case to react to the free spending of private citizens, despite the &quot;compelling interest&quot; of preventing corruption, encouraging a robust debate, etc.? Would you be ok with this kind of matching if it were 30 cents on the dollar instead of 94 cents?</span>
