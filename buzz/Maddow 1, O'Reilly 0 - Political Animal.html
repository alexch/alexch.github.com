<span class="entry-title entry-content">Also because they try not to lie, and when they make a mistake they admit it. False equivalency between left and right (and in particular between Fox and MSNBC) really chaps my ass.<br /><br />BTW, that article you linked really shows how lame O&#39;Reilly is:<br /><br />* he apologized for &quot;not doing his homework,&quot; which is really the whole point here: he leapt at the chance to smear someone, like he&#39;s done many times before, and he only apologized this time because he got caught by someone other than Olbermann or Franken<br /><br />* he couldn&#39;t resist the chance to claim that he too has been victimized by being taken out of context<br /><br />* he also couldn&#39;t resist claiming that Sherrod really is racist after all, so he really was right all along<br /><br />In all, a classic non-apology apology from a classic crybaby. How can you say that&#39;s equivalent to anything that any MSNBC host has ever said on air?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">O&#39;Reilly is such an over the top character that is so over the top that Comedy Central gave Stephen Colbert a show to mock him 4 days a week.  Why are you so shocked and outraged that O&#39;Reilly took shots at someone during an apology?  I would expect nothing less from O&#39;Reilly.<br /><br />MSNBC tries not to lie so it&#39;s OK when they do because their heart is in the right place?<br /><br />Fox News intentionally lies?  That&#39;s quite an indictment.  You&#39;d think by now someone would have some evidence of intentional lying by now.  I&#39;ll believe that there&#39;s a lack of controls and fact checking at Fox News, but I have serious doubts that it is intentional.<br /><br />Let&#39;s keep in mind that Olberman&#39;s show is not a news report.  O&#39;Reilly&#39;s show is not a news report.  Rachel Maddow&#39;s show is not a news report.  They&#39;re all windbags telling people what they want to hear.  It&#39;s more of a lack of not caring if it&#39;s true or not then an intentional lie.<br /><br />The truth is, they all lie!  You should not expect truthful content from any of them.  Again, they are not news reports.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/keith-olbermann/" >http://www.politifact.com/personalities/keith-olbermann/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rachel-maddow/" >http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rachel-maddow/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bill-oreilly/" >http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bill-oreilly/</a><br /><br />The bottom line is that White House or Ag Department fired Sherrod before O&#39;Reilly and Fox News mentioned the story.  &quot;O&#39;Reilly taped the show at 5 p.m., and by the time it aired about 8:50, USDA had announced Sherrod&#39;s resignation (as Fox noted on the screen). Fox executives say O&#39;Reilly&#39;s staff, which is not part of the news division, sought comment from USDA throughout the day.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/22/AR2010072201265.html" >http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/22/AR2010072201265.html</a><br /><br />P.S.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Thanks for those politifact links, since they support my point. Rachel Maddow had two out of 5 &quot;false&quot;, one of which was well and clearly sourced, and her response was quick and professional: The show did try to research the issue, &quot;but obviously our fact-check fell short,&quot; Maddow said in a statement to PolitiFact. &quot;We&#39;ll air a correction.&quot;<br /><br />Keith, too, apologized promptly and professionally: &quot;One last note on the subject of oil. An apology and thank you, apologies to you for getting this wrong this past Tuesday... and our thanks to PolitiFact.com which brought this to light and guessed correctly that we misread the report, and our thanks to them for only rating our report &quot;false&quot; rather than their other option &#39;pants on fire.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />O&#39;Reilly, otoh, had 4 out of 5 &quot;falses,&quot; one of which was &quot;pants on fire,&quot; rarely offers a correction on-air (and when he does makes it self-serving), and purposefully does things that (again from politifact) &quot;confuse the issue&quot;.<br /><br />&gt; Why are you so shocked and outraged that O&#39;Reilly took shots at someone during an apology?<br /><br />I am neither shocked nor outraged at O&#39;Reilly&#39;s antics. As you say, he&#39;s a clown. What I said was that I&#39;m annoyed when people draw false equivalence between O&#39;Reilly and Maddow, or O&#39;Reilly and Olbermann (though the latter is somewhat bumbling and prone to hyperbole, he&#39;s not an outright liar or scumbag).<br /><br />BTW congrats on hitting another of my pet peeves -- to unfairly characterize leftist commentary as shrill, shocked, outraged, and other infantile emotional states.<br /><br />&gt; Fox News intentionally lies? That&#39;s quite an indictment. You&#39;d think by now someone would have some evidence of intentional lying by now.<br /><br /><a href="http://mediamatters.org/" >http://mediamatters.org/</a><br /><a href="http://www.politifact.com/" >http://www.politifact.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Lying-Liars-Tell-Them/dp/0525947647" >http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Lying-Liars-Tell-Them/dp/0525947647</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fox+lying" >http://www.google.com/search?q=fox+lying</a><br /><br />BTW lying is not against the law (damn that pesky First Amendment!) so I don&#39;t know why you think they haven&#39;t been lying this whole time.<br /><br />&gt; P.S. I don&#39;t watch any of these windbags.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching Rachel Maddow, if you&#39;ve got the time: she is one of the few windbags who can communicate clearly, calmly, respectfully, and with a sense of humor about all sorts of issues. She&#39;s really really smart and nice and a good interviewer. And you can check her facts all you want, too, and she won&#39;t get huffy about it.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">You said that Fox News intentionally lied.  That is something quite different than not having the facts straight or being incompetent.  That&#39;s knowing the truth and intentionally disregarding it for some falsehood.<br /><br />Did I unfairly characterize leftist commentary as shrill, shocked, outraged, and other infantile emotional states?  I re-read my comment to try to figure out what triggered that remark.  I don&#39;t see it.  It it helps, I would say that O&#39;Reilly, Limbaugh, and Hannity all rely on playing the same shock and outrage emotions.<br /><br />Something really bothers me about defending a show because &quot;they lie less often than that other guy.&quot;<br /><br />BTW, I&#39;m been confused why I don&#39;t see the word intentional in your comment anymore.  Did you go back an edit it out?  I really hope this conversation isn&#39;t based on me misreading what you wrote.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I didn&#39;t say &quot;intentionally lie&quot; because that would be redundant; a lie is when you say something untrue knowing it is untrue, or when you say something that&#39;s technically true but is only part of the picture, and the full story runs counter to your desired narrative (a lie by omission). Saying something untrue to score political points without being confident in your sources and facts is also a form of lying; trying to do research but getting the facts wrong is a mistake made in good faith, not really a lie. So no, I never said &quot;intentional&quot; but I think you got my point: Fox lies (by omission and commission) far more than MSNBC, so saying &quot;they&#39;re all liars&quot; misses an important truth.<br /><br />You said (or your question implied) that I was shocked and outraged at O&#39;Reilly, that&#39;s where I got the shocked and outraged part from. I added &quot;shrill&quot; cause that&#39;s the dog-whistle word that captures the pattern. Liberals are &quot;shrill&quot; when they&#39;re right; conservatives are &quot;serious&quot; when they&#39;re wrong. Granted, I was again holding you up as a proxy for all that is wrong with our political discourse, but at least this time I wasn&#39;t putting words in your mouth! :-) (for 2 out of 3 words, that is)</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The disconnect here is that I didn&#39;t see your comment as &quot;leftist commentary.&quot;  I saw your comment simply as, &quot;Alex Chaffee&#39;s comment.&quot;  Your political views seem to be liberal, but I never put your comments in the &quot;leftest commentary bucket.&quot;<br /><br />Intentionally lying is redundant.  The problem is that it&#39;s popular to go back and label things as a lie when they were originally thought to be true and said in good faith.  <br /><br />When looking back at the Sherrod story, can anyone say for sure that Fox News or O&#39;Reilly knew that there was more to the story but held back?  Or, did they just become giddy, forget to the fact checking, and rush to report the story?  I&#39;m going with the latter.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I agree with Alex.  An intentional lie of omission is definitely a lie, and Fox News does that all the time to serve their conservative agenda.  <br /><br />Of course, I would also characterize the vast majority of other Mainstream Media &quot;News&quot; as &quot;lies of omission&quot;.  This is because it benefits their corporate status quo owners by ignoring flashing red lights and claxons (e.g. accelerating destruction of the global ecosystem due to uncontrolled growth and consumption, our unsustainable dependence on oil, etc), to the long-term detriment of all human entities on Earth.  <br /><br />However, actually reporting on these dire circumstances and the somber responses we must start taking as a species is definitely NOT in the short-term interest of the corporate status quo and the plutocracy which owns it.  So, every newscast which distracts the populace with the latest shiny object while ignoring these topics is a lie of omission; or at best, self-serving and duplicitous.</span>
