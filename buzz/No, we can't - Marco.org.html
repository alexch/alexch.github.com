<span class="entry-title entry-content">The fact is that Washington is so messed up and broken that there is no way Obama was going to be able to walk in there and just &quot;fix&quot; everything.  The Congress is so in bed with corporate interests, regardless of R&#39;s or D&#39;s, that the idea that Obama could repair this or beat out the entrenched powers is laughable.  If all those who voted for Obama (I did too) want actual change, start looking at your representatives and senators.  Start thinking outside of the 2 party box, and start thinking independently.  <br /><br />I like Obama too and thought he had our (the US) interests in mind. I think it comes down to 2 options, either what I say above is true, or when Obama took office he learned the truth, and is doing exactly what he is told.  Conspiracy theorist?  Maybe.....</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">So do you guys just not believe in financial collapse, despite all the historical evidence?  I guess part of the problem with bailing out financial institutions in the middle of a crisis is the public never gets a demonstration of what it&#39;s like in a real collapse.  Suffice it to say the Fed and most of modern monetary theory and policy was put together in response to monetary shocks.<br /><br />...which is all apart from the question of whether big banks are of any advantage in normal times...I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s no evidence that this is the case.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">When TARP happened one great proposal I heard was to give money to all the little banks who had had good lending practices, and get them to buy up the crappy mortgages from all the big banks at fire sale prices while the big banks failed. Would that have been too chaotic? Would it have hurt the economy (notwithstanding Citigroup share prices)?<br /><br />Another great populist proposal was to bail out homeowners, not banks, which would make the assets non-toxic. But I guess it&#39;s better politically to give free money to rich people than poor people for some reason.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Yes, it would have started a vicious cycle and markets would have spiraled out of control.  I guess from our nice stable perch here in 2010 that sounds like hyperbole, but again there&#39;s a pretty long history of what happens when there&#39;s a credit shock. I personally like the fact that we have a Fed and a government that allows us to live in ignorance of what a real 19th-century-style credit crisis applied to a much more interconnected and scaled up economy would look like.<br /><br />People don&#39;t give out loans, people don&#39;t have weird derivatives on their books.  This was all about putting a bunch of cash in the hands of technocrats to keep a short-term liquidity and confidence crisis from becoming a full-blown long-term &quot;Main street&quot; disaster.<br /><br />But it seems to me that it&#39;s not a terrible idea to follow up a TARP bailout with a deep questioning of whether too-big-to-fail banks ought to exist, or exist in the form that they do right now.  Not sure what the answer to that is.  People say good things about the Volcker plan.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">There are alternate perspectives than those you stated, and history to the contrary.  The Fed IS member banks; fractional reserve is not necessary for governments to control and grow/shrink the money supply (e.g. the Treasury could spend/loan fiat currency directly into existence); and currency does not have to be backed by commodities (there are many historical examples of this, including the United States Notes/greenbacks until they were finally supplanted by Federal Reserve Notes, as well as many local currency systems).<br /><br />Money is not and does not have to be debt.  Let me repeat: Money is not and does not have to be debt.  Its basic purpose is to facilitate non-barter-based commerce.  The debt-based aspect of the current American currency serves to enrich only bankers and speculators at the expense of everyone else.  Well, economists too, I guess, which probably explains why mainstream economics does not emphasize this distinction.<br /><br />It is so simple as to be absurd:  The US Govt (Treasury) CREATES (printed/electronic) notes for the Fed, then buys these notes back from the Fed (Banks/Brokers) AT INTEREST; interest which I must pay with MY TAXES.  Umm, I say eliminate the middle man and lower my taxes.  Yes, the inherent greed of Man and flaws of Civilization will result in myriad other problems, but that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t eliminate the one glaring us in the face.<br /><br />The 19th century credit crises up through 1907, just like the current one, originated in the New York stock markets, and were due to over-leveraged margin buying, short selling, and speculators/brokers who could not cover their positions and the banks who gave them money (in other words, the weak and stupid who deserve to die a Darwinian death in the free market).  Then, like now, the &quot;solutions&quot; involved large banks and corporations ending up with more money and power (leading up to the secret establishment of the Fed on Jeckyll Island).<br /><br />So, what is the solution?<br /><br />An alternative would be for the government to encourage local banks, decentralization, and prudent, non-risky behavior; and discourage/regulate/expose stupid risky behavior.  Yes, Greenspan, I said regulate; you Ayn Rand-reading wrinkled old worm.  Then again, this policy approach wouldn&#39;t result in more money and power for large banks and corporations.  So, their lobbyists/propagandists/interlocking boards make sure it never happens by keeping the Executive and Legislative branches (and the public) confused/scared/ignorant/distracted/bought.<br /><br />We have the Internet and Computers now, it&#39;s not hard to disseminate information about which institutions are solvent and which are not, which seem to me to be the logical remedy to an 18th-century style Panic (or exposing the bubble makers before they can even get big/leveraged enough to cause problems).  I know that my local Credit Unions were loaning money even at the beginning of the current &quot;crisis&quot;, and if we were (encouraged to be) more of a saver nation than a debtor nation, those local non-fractional reserve based institutions would have even more lending ability.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it&#39;s entirely too easy to buy/bribe/blackmail a Congressperson, so we get more centralization and less transparency, which is a positive feedback loop resulting in an ever larger and more powerful financial sector.<br /><br />Again, Ellen Brown&#39;s book is well-written and well-cited on many of these topics, if a bit repetitive.  I didn&#39;t reference her book for this screed, however; I just researched this on Wikipedia and wrote it up.  Thanks for the discussion :)<br /><br />It isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s all in the open and historically documented; and it isn&#39;t a monopoly, there are many players, but the finance industry and plutocracy/elite all act in their own interest, so the net effect is the same.  You do, though, have to admire it as the most successful propaganda campaign in the history of mankind.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">No offense, Chad, but I think the title of &quot;most successful propaganda campaign in the history of mankind&quot; has to go to theism. (I was going to say &quot;religion&quot; at first, but Buddhism and Confucianism aren&#39;t quite as false as most of the others.)<br /><br />I am out of my depth wrt fractional reserve and whether money is or is not debt, but I feel I need to point out that after browsing Ellen Brown&#39;s web site you linked to, she does show several symptoms of a dangerous disorder: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(person)#Common_characteristics_of_cranks" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(person)#Common_characteristics_of_cranks</a></span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Yes, she may be a crank, but I also think those characteristics are very applicable to politicians/economists/pundits/propagandists as well.<br /><br />Also, much of this stuff is verifiable history, not just random baseless ranting and speculation (i.e. what you mostly hear from politicians, economists, and pundits).<br /><br />Bottom line - there are other economic/currency approaches than the debt-based system we currently have, but you&#39;ll never hear it because the current rentier/financier status quo has control and will maintain it at any cost.  <br /><br />Maybe none of the alternatives can successfully scale to the level of global growth and trade which we currently have, but maybe that&#39;s just because civilization can&#39;t scale to that level, and our infinite compound-growth-based global economy cannot exist in our finite world.  However, alternate approaches have been proven to work sustainably on a smaller scale many times throughout history.</span>
