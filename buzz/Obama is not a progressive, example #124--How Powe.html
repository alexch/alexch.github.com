<span class="entry-title entry-content">Steve, I&#39;m glad you agree with me that Obama is not a progressive, despite his early indispensible support from the organized left and netroots. I guess our only difference is that I&#39;m disappointed by this fact and you (and for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out why) relish it.<br /><br />As for the public option, &quot;because&quot; is a tricky word. Certainly no single member of the Senate forced, or even asked them to dump it preemptively, and as a tactic it certainly didn&#39;t gain them any Republican votes or speed the progress of the bill. The Blue Dogs et al. would have fought just as hard against any proposal, so why not start with something strong and let your opponents water it down? (Answer: because they made a Emanuel-brokered deal with the insurance companies in early 2009.)<br /><br />Kevin, the President is the most listened-to man on the planet. Even if his technical power is limited, he can frame the debate, move the goalposts, crack open the Overton Window -- choose your favorite metaphor -- and hey, Super Clerk Powers like executive orders and recess appointments shouldn&#39;t be just for W(orst Potus Ever)! (Shed a tear for poor Dawn Johnsen, hung out to dry for a year and a half for having mainstream opinions and daring to write them down.)</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;despite his early indispensible support from the organized left and netroots.&quot;<br /><br />This says MUCH more about netroots.  Their other choice was Clinton so it&#39;s not a big surprise.  I don&#39;t know what else the guy had to say to call out the fact that he&#39;s not in alignment with this crowd.  How many other politicians send letters directly to Kos directly calling out their differences?  I mean, should he have run a blog and posted to it once a week saying &quot;I&#39;m a moderate&quot;?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;I&#39;m disappointed by this fact and you (and for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out why) relish it.&quot;<br /><br />Because they are facile and ineffectual.  They are infected with a Robespierre-like attitude toward progress: you can simply gut the corporations, for example, and replace the established order with making shit up, ex nihilo (like invading Iraq - anything is better than Saddam!  Even civil war, and 25-year-old former college republicans running state agencies).  There is little respect for hard work of incremental institutional reform, and a lot of easy armchair throw-out-the-bums radicalism.  This is what the founders designed the Constitution to try and check - the passions of the masses, which they saw as a threat to stability.  Netroots are not a whole lot more than a passionate mass.<br /><br />Which doesn&#39;t mean the right doesn&#39;t have the same problem, in fact today&#39;s right is demented and dangerous - moreover, Republican leaders are <b>actually</b> seeking the blessings and doing the bidding of the crazy wing, and their intellectual types are truly dangerous and irresponsible people like Kristol and Kagan and Wolfowitz and Krauthammer, whereas netroots are merely annoying.  I can do business with netroots, grudgingly.  There are even a few good ideas that come out of the netroot movement.  Ok I said it.<br /><br /><br />&quot;I am not drawing a facile equivalence here between progressive advocacy groups and right-wing advocacy groups. The consequences of their ideas are vastly different. Fighting on behalf of the poor and the vulnerable is not the same as fighting for homophobia and Halliburton. But to the degree that we brook no dissent within the Democratic Party, and demand fealty to the one, “true” progressive vision for the country, we risk the very thoughtfulness and openness to new ideas that are required to move this country forward. When we lash out at those who share our fundamental values because they have not met the criteria of every single item on our progressive “checklist,” then we are essentially preventing them from thinking in new ways about problems. We are tying them up in a straightjacket and forcing them into a conversation only with the converted.<br /><br />Beyond that, by applying such tests, we are hamstringing our ability to build a majority. We won’t be able to transform the country with such a polarized electorate&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s about right.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;There is little respect for hard work of incremental institutional reform&quot;<br /><br />I have little respect for it, because I believe it is doomed to fail, and the longer it takes, the worse off we will be.  Corporate and Plutocratic interests have captured and consolidated power against all challengers.  No, not conspiracy-theory consolidation, but consolidation in that they are all wielding their vastly disproportionate influence by acting in their own similar interests (which is almost without exception against the long-term interest of our species as a whole).<br /><br />Thus, any &quot;reform&quot; will be as minimally incremental as possible, and rendered ineffective anyway through repeal or non-enforcement (at an opportune time, of course, when bread and circuses provide maximum distration, and the netroots masses are in a froth over some other unrelated and ultimately meaningless shiny object such as, say, health care reform).<br /><br />The status quo is unsustainable.  A drastically reduced energy supply due to Peak Oil is unavoidable and imminent.  &quot;Incremental institutional reform&quot; cannot save us from globalism and this institutionalized debt-feudal society which passes as a bastardized simulacrum of Capitalism.  The POTUS, all those one-party party-line windbags on the hill, all the lobbyists - they cannot and will not and have no real interest to save us.  They will only squander the last fleeting chances we have to actually turn this thing around and make a soft landing (e.g. diverse renewable non-destructive energy sources and re-localized economies) instead of a hard, painful crash for the next few generations.<br /><br />So, yeah, count me in to &quot;simply gut the corporations, for example, and replace the established order with making shit up&quot;.  What we have now ain&#39;t working, ain&#39;t in my interest, and it ain&#39;t gonna be changed from the top down.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Look at the French vs American revolutions for what happens when you simply smash existing institutions replaced with only some vacuous theory of how things might work, vs co-opting the existing order and reforming it.<br /><br />Yes corporations act in their self-interest, but to say they are untouchable or unreformable is ahistorical.  You have to put the blinders on.  We split up AT&amp;T, turned the banks into utilities in the 30&#39;s and then set them free in the 90&#39;s.  The Netherlands has a 100% private healthcare system.<br /><br />I will make a general claim that anyone who is a non-practitioner who says we should chuck a wrench into or raze an existing large and time-tested institution - undoubtedly because the rot is too deep, there&#39;s a crisis happening RIGHT NOW, etc - these are people who should be kept from real power.  They invariably face incentives that cause them to maximize the vitriol of their rhetoric.  In order to break through - on the internet, in print, on radio, among the masses - they need to be saying radical things that get them noticed.  In the worst cases they lay the groundwork for the Kristols and Wolfowitzes.</span>

For example, completely abolishing/nationalizing the Fed and allowing state and local governments to print their own currency and have their own publicly-owned banks.  Yes, terribly disruptive, but still a good idea, even if we don&#39;t know exactly what will happen.  Whatever it is, I&#39;m willing to make a &quot;bets&quot; (just like the multi-trillion derivatives market, heh) that it will be better than the status quo.<br /><br />I also believe that references to pre-industrial-revolution global or national events are somewhat irrelevant in todays society.  The exponential explosion of almost everything due to cheap energy via cheap oil, as well as the arrival of the global information society, has fundamentally changed the playing field.  If we could somehow magically usurp the entrenched global power players, or snap our fingers and abolish the Fed and other central banks, I think things would play out in a way which would be very poorly predicted by similar global situations in the past.<br /><br />-- Chad</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">OK Steve, that may be an appropriate response to Chad, but I didn&#39;t hear anyone on the left saying we need to raze the entire health care delivery system in this country -- just that we should have a government-run option for the payment part of it. Medicare has been doing this for decades, so it&#39;s neither untested nor radical. And we could do a phase-in, by gradually dropping the age minimum or raising the income maximum, to make it less jarring a change. &quot;Medicare For All&quot; is not &quot;Anarchy Now&quot; -- and I&#39;m sick of straw man arguments from smug centrist hippie-haters.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">First of all I don&#39;t think anyone would make the claim that the public option as proposed would have been a problem.  I mean, it was so vanishingly small and restrictive in terms of who would have qualified I&#39;m kind of surprised there was so much vehement support for it.<br /><br />But the netroot rhetoric was along the lines of, corporations can&#39;t run insurance (like, this was ALL over the place for months, don&#39;t you remember?), and we&#39;d really rather have single payer.  That&#39;s a fine solution in a place like France but that&#39;s not at all what we have, and the transition to something like that might well have been chaos.<br /><br />And the umbrage having to do with strawmen is overdone.  You can&#39;t call accusations that don&#39;t squarely fit your idea of what&#39;s &quot;fair&quot; at any given point in time a strawman.  Whether some claim is in fact a strawman seems to me to be not entirely subjective - google&#39;s right there.<br /><br />I stand by my accusation that netroots are mostly an enraged mass.  That&#39;s what Obama was saying, in a nice way.  It&#39;s possible to make significant reforms like HCR and not be a mushy centrist - mushy centrism is a whole other animal, where the Clintons were the best examples.  <br /><br />Hey there&#39;s a pretty stellar financial reform bill that passed.  Yay reform.  Yay real governance and leadership and dealmaking and hard work.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I agree that I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by the financial reform bill, but I would hardly call it &quot;Stellar&quot;.  Ironically (given this thread), we largely have the NetRoots to benefit for that.  During the committee, I was bombarded by appeals to call Congress, and help expose the ones who were rolling over for their lobbyist overlords.  I made a couple calls, one to my representative, and another to Barney Frank.<br /><br />We also have NetRoots to thank for the derivatives reform section of the bill, because of Blanche Lincoln.  When it was being debated in the Senate, Lincoln was in a primary fight for her life against a candidate heavily backed by NetRoots supporters enraged by her lack of support for the public healthcare option (&quot;Bold Progressives&quot;).  Her introduction of the derivatives language was a direct response to block them (and it worked, she won in a recount by the skin of her teeth).<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty convinced that without the internet and NetRoots organization, that wouldn&#39;t have happened.  Which supports my point that we are in a new age, and prior revolutions will not be good predictors of the next one.<br /><br />-- Chad</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Um, if this sort of transactional churn BS is &quot;market efficiency&quot;, I think we can do without it (didn&#39;t read that article, it was just the first google hit which explained HFTP and how they benefit investment firms):<br /><br /><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/153555-five-reasons-the-market-could-crash-this-fall" >http://seekingalpha.com/article/153555-five-reasons-the-market-could-crash-this-fall</a><br /><br />From my perspective, all this does is make Goldman Sachs and their ilk richer.  This has nothing to do with providing capital to worthy endeavors of labor and service - it&#39;s just rich people getting richer by playing games with normal people&#39;s investments.<br /><br />Think of it - in that example, the FIRST trade is for $1000.  If there were a 0.0001, that is a penny tax on that transaction.  If a SINGLE PENNY makes a thousand-dollar transaction unprofitable, then that transaction didn&#39;t deserve to be made in the first place.<br /><br />Hell, make it a tenth of a cent.  Dunno the numbers, but given the market volume, I&#39;m pretty sure even that minuscule level of taxation could eliminate personal federal income tax.<br /><br />Sure, make the argument that this sort of taxation would drive financial markets to other countries, kill Wall Street, destroy our dominance of financial markets, etc...<br /><br />Good riddance I say.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">OK, so a couple of points:<br /><br />1. This is fun! We&#39;re actually debating substantive policy on Google Buzz!<br /><br />2. Steve, I echo Chad that the example of the recent financial reform package is actually an argument for our side: the netroots pushed the Dems, including Obama, to be strong, and we got a better bill for it. And the bill will be better politically since the Dems will be able to say &quot;look at this great bill we got you that the Republicans were against&quot; this Fall. <br />e.g. The Volcker Rule was pronounced dead, then revived due to pressure from and on actual progressives in Congress, not anyone in the Administration.<br /><br />3. Kevin, your two statements on Jun 27 8:23 PM are a much better example of what Steve was complaining about than my various laments -- they&#39;re as anti-incrementalist as anything the frothing Left or Right ever said. (&quot;The financial reform bill is a failure because [they don&#39;t include Fannie and Freddie]&quot; and &quot;The public option was left out because it largely seen as a path to single-payer&quot;.) I&#39;m not quite sure where you fall in the 5-dimensional political hypercube but thanks for the example of extreme something-or-otherism :-)<br /><br />4. &quot;market efficiency&quot; is like &quot;national security&quot; -- it&#39;s a meaningless term used to bludgeon opponents. It rests on so many assumptions about economics and power structures that it&#39;s difficult to understand, let alone rebut.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">You may be debating policy on Buzz, Alex, but I&#39;m in Reader. My Buzz has been off for quite some time and it&#39;s staying that way.<br /><br />My impression of Steve is that he appears to have some kind of belief that our system, which has been outrageously corrupted by money and corporations, is fair. Strangely, Steve&#39;s view appears to be that if the system doesn&#39;t pass good legislation, it&#39;s the fault of the people who openly call for good legislation to be passed, rather than a failure of the system itself (&quot;senate = reality&quot;, i.e, if you&#39;re on the losing side within the system your ideas/arguments are inherently wrong).<br /><br />And then he seems to get a charge out of sneering at ordinary citizens who want the government to do something useful, because they openly object to the corruption (&quot;facile&quot;) and don&#39;t have the power to clean up the system (&quot;ineffectual&quot;). Bizarre.<br /><br />Every time we ask Steve &quot;what about what&#39;s right?&quot; he refuses to answer and starts going back to talking about votes and historical trends. He doesn&#39;t want to overturn or upset any institutions and favors incremental change, yet he doesn&#39;t appear to notice that Republicans and companies have been gutting the institutions that used to work fine, <b>incrementally</b>, for the last 20-30 years.<br /><br />It might be fair to simply say Steve is a &quot;conservative&quot;, which isn&#39;t a very nice word in my estimation but might be accurate.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I didn&#39;t say what should happen with Fannie and Freddie, but they contributed to the financial crisis and our costing us billions of dollars.  I thought the financial bill was supposed to address the causes of the crisis and fix them, so we don&#39;t have to go through this again.  To allow the quasi-government institution to continue to make risky bets at the expense of the tax payer is a failure.<br /><br />High volume traders bridging markets create market efficiencies.  It&#39;s no myth.  If you can buy a security and not have to check the other markets for a better price, that&#39;s an improvement in efficiency.  The high volume trading (mentioned in the searching for alpha blog) that does nothing other than to add an additional middle man&#39;s fee to a transaction isn&#39;t desirable at all.  I understood the Tobin tax to be a tax on currency exchanges.  Perhaps the scope has changed.  Still, unless you can get other nations to agree the tax, it will be easily avoided by the multinationals that dominate trading.<br /><br />I&#39;m confused how Steve&#39;s argument for incremental change is negated by &quot;Republicans and companies have been gutting the institutions that used to work fine, incrementally, for the last 20-30 years.&quot;  If anything, that statement proves that destruction through incremental change can happen.  Too bad it never actually happened.  Corporations only co-opt government institutions for their own goals, at the expense of competition AND regulation.  I&#39;m not sure why we keep making this mistake over and over again.  William Jennings Bryan lobbied for more railroad regulation and eventually got his wish.  Soon after, the interest in the railroad commission waned for everyone except the railroads.  The railroads quickly packed the commission and used it to limit competition and preserve their profits.<br /><br />On the 5-dimensional political hypercube, my beliefs fall on side 42.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Yes, by Tobin Tax, I mean a tax on all financial market transactions.  Just like the taxes I have to pay on my daily transactions (only orders of magnitude higher).<br /><br />As for multinationals avoiding it, I&#39;d like to see how that plays out.  Since other nations with major stock exchanges (EU, Japan) also have major financial problems, they might just jump on the bandwagon.  But then, you say, that would drive market activity to exchanges which do not charge the taxes.  OK, it may.  So lets impose tariffs and taxes on all US activity of these multinational Banks and Investment Firms that attempt to avoid our markets.<br /><br />Will this affect America negatively?  Conservatives and corporate apologists will say do.  Again, good riddance I say.  Just like Jesus driving the moneychangers out of the temple - Christianity reference just for you, Alex :)  If it encourages the decline of the petro-dollar, and encourages real local economies and local currencies in America, I&#39;m all for it.  Call me an isolationist.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Kevin, the point about incremental change, I suppose, is that anything that takes more time, effort and (perhaps therefore) money automatically benefits the corporations, industries, and lobbyists who can afford to spend 100% of their time on it and grind results out of the system (in many cases a successful result for them is simply killing or watering down legislation). If it&#39;s only incremental change that&#39;s possible, the status quo and moneyed interests will win absent the most extraordinary public outcry. <br /><br />When you win an election and for a short time can claim to have a mandate--&quot;the people sent me here to do this!!&quot;--you need to go at the changes you want hammer &amp; tongs to get as much done in the short time window as possible. You also need to be strong and stand for something. This is where Obama&#39;s tactics are wrong imo. He is too scared (substitute &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;level-headed&quot; if you are conservative) to ask for what he really wants, much less what his constituents want.<br /><br />Tobin tax or similar = yes</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I wouldn&#39;t want to see how a Tobin-like tax plays out.  Other countries would rather get the taxes on income and the jobs that come when a getting a corporation to relocate.  Basically, the same thing we see when states try to land a company that&#39;s thinking about relocating to a more business friendly state.  A Tobin-like tax would be very difficult to collect unless done at the exchange level too.  The net-effect would be lost jobs, lost corporate taxes, and not nearly enough Tobin-like tax revenue from the under-utilized American exchanges.<br /><br />You want me to call you an isolationist?  I could, but I&#39;d rather just call you, &quot;Poorer in the long run.&quot;  Maybe that&#39;s ok for you.  Maybe you&#39;ll just deny the fact that free trading nations are more prosperous than the ones that put up barriers to trade.<br /><br />The thing about laws and lobbying is that both sides are playing.  It&#39;s rarely all one sided, and corporate dominated.  Usually, when there&#39;s a push, there&#39;s a pull to even it out.  Even the government agencies that deserve to be gutted have lobbyists to protect their fiefdoms.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;Usually, when there&#39;s a push, there&#39;s a pull to even it out.&quot;<br /><br />I beg to differ.  Usually, when there&#39;s a tug-of-war battle, the side with the most power, money, and influence wins.  And, since most battles that corporations/feifdoms deem worth having are over power, money, and influence, this results in a positive feedback loop.<br /><br />As the financial reform bill shows, herculean efforts by NetRoots can influence this slightly, but I&#39;m pessimistic - these will just get gutted or repealed or amended away when nobody is looking (easy enough when you have enough power, money, and influence).</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The fact that there is a financial services reform bill at disproves the point that the side with the most money, power and influence wins.  Who has more money, power and influence than Wall Street and the banks?  Wall Street doesn&#39;t want any regulation, yet, somehow, despite having way more money, power, and influence, more regulation and over sight is coming their way.  Visa and Mastercard couldn&#39;t completely gut Durbin&#39;s interchange fee amendment.<br /><br />And tell me this, why participate in this NetRoots thing if your group is never going to have more money, power, and influence than the opponent?  You&#39;re either sadistic or you really don&#39;t believe what you wrote.  I&#39;d bet on the latter.<br /><br />Sure, individuals don&#39;t have lobbyists, but most charities they give to do.  Most the professional organizations do.  If you&#39;re a union member, your union has lobbyist.  AAA has a lobbyist.  The NRA has lobbyists.  AARP has lobbyists.  You&#39;re not heard as an individual, but the things you care about most likely are.<br /><br />The system we have is far from perfect, but it&#39;s rarely a one sided contest.

You&#39;re either sadistic or you really don&#39;t believe what you wrote. I&#39;d bet on the latter.&quot;<br /><br />Because it&#39;s the only meaningful action I can take.  I believe the odds are very low for it to have any significant impact - collapse/devolution of the status quo under its own weight is much more likely.  I&#39;m preparing for that scenario as well (mostly by educating myself as I do not have the resources to prepare/opt out as I would like to).  <br /><br />So, it is a low-value long shot bet, but it&#39;s also very cheap (reading emails, signing petitions, phoning my congresspeople).<br /><br />Also, humans (of which I am one) get depressed when they feel they have no control over their situation.  So, doing something - anything - that seems meaningful helps my outlook, even if it is a miniscule impact.<br /><br />Also, the benefit is not just about changing the institution and system itself - it is also about raising people&#39;s awareness about the evils of the current system - enlightening them to the fact that there is an alternative that they don&#39;t hear about on the corporate-owned main stream media.  It&#39;s the Pareto Principle 80/20 rule - if 1/5 the population wakes up, the rest will follow.<br /><br />And on that note - I believe/hope that community and relationships will be much more important in the future.  If we are lucky, one which has fewer walmarts and global agribusinesses and multinational finance corporations/banks, and more local stores, community farms, and local credit unions / script/currency.  For me, being involved in NetRoots isn&#39;t about changing corporate ownership of congress, it&#39;s about being involved in the transformation to a world where that ownership is mostly irrelevant to me.<br /><br />I can dream, right?</span>

I didn&#39;t say anything about what&#39;s fair; I refuted the claim that all lefty criticisms are radical &quot;blow up the system&quot; manifestos.&quot;<br /><br /><br />* Anyone who was advocating for single-payer is exactly that<br />* I feel like this is some kind of postmodernist trap - Steve Conover will not be fooled<br /><br />-----<br /><br />&quot;My impression of Steve is that he appears to have some kind of belief that our system, which has been outrageously corrupted by money and corporations, is fair.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Fair&quot; is bullshit.  I have no idea what that means.  Moreover it&#39;s a door into the politics of grievance and resentment and victimization - a complete dead-end.  I can go for, &quot;the system should not be cruel&quot;, but I have very little interest in fairness, well WRT matters economic anyway.  You might say that we ought to offer parents free child care and I might agree, but not because it&#39;s fairer.  You might say citizen ought to have a right to a free education.  I would say, citizens ought to be forced to be educated up to a certain age as a (meager) defense against ignorant masses trashing the constitution and clamoring for the bombing of brown people as soon as 3 Americans get blown up in a place featured in the Travel section.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />&quot;And then he seems to get a charge out of sneering at ordinary citizens who want the government to do something useful, because they openly object to the corruption (&quot;facile&quot;) and don&#39;t have the power to clean up the system (&quot;ineffectual&quot;). Bizarre.&quot;<br /><br />I am aghast at your lack of self-awareness when you cast the clean government against the corrupt other.  This is in the face of the totality of the historical record as long as there&#39;s been one, current events, public choice theory, on and on.  It&#39;s a rare regulatory agency that isn&#39;t totally compromised and captured by outside interests, or simply existing as a power center, their leaders shaking down anyone who hasn&#39;t shown proper fealty.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />&quot;Republicans and companies have been gutting the institutions that used to work fine, incrementally, for the last 20-30 years.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m with you on that!  Or my sense is it&#39;s not just gutting (there&#39;s certainly been that, and Dick Morris Clintonism was just as bad - that&#39;s not to say dems are equally to blame, but it calls out a conservative environment they couldn&#39;t resist) - maybe the worst part is that in America government in general is suspect.  At least half of the population just bashes it...as much as France has problems, when your kid goes into the civil service it&#39;s seen as a very good thing.  Or at least, not that bad.  Sometimes I wonder whether single payer just wouldn&#39;t work here given the disdain we have for govt endeavors...well except where it comes to bombing brown people.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />&quot;It might be fair to simply say Steve is a &quot;conservative&quot;, which isn&#39;t a very nice word in my estimation but might be accurate.&quot;<br /><br />It depends on what you mean by that.  One of the attractions of Sullivan&#39;s blog (in spite of his well-documented tendency to get overheated and too passionate) is his take on conservatism.  In this view there are very few real conservatives on the Right nowadays...they are truly, dangerously radical (their SC candidates appear to be fellow traveler radicals too).  And as I tried to point out in my earlier statements, while in rhetoric the netroots and the Nation left are often wildly radical, they are often a good tension on the party (sometimes not, as in the Hamsher/Dean idiocy WRT dumping HRC...it reminds me of how terrible Dean was as a pres. prospect) - Obama and co do not bow down to them like the right does to their crazies.<br /><br />You could label me Burkean.  There are zero real Burkeans in the Republican party, certainly among big-C Conservatives.  I&#39;d also call myself a liberal-liberaltarian who&#39;s perfectly willing to meet a classic left in the middle on most issues.  You lose me on corporations=corrupt, government=not corrupt.  And the anti-science crap like resistance to GM (and accompanying corporationey conspriacies) drives me up the wall.<br /><br />I&#39;d agree with the idea that government is often the last defense for regular people - that&#39;s a valid function of govt.  Maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;d call being fair, but I don&#39;t think of it that way.</span>
