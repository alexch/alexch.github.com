<div class="original-content">Ooh! Ooh! &quot;Giddy but bemused&quot; -- that&#39;s me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the comment I just left on his site:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point is not whether or not he has accomplished specific things. It&#39;s that whatever he has or hasn&#39;t done, he&#39;s done so while appearing to be weak and conciliatory and un-leader-like. This allows potshots from all sides (thus hurting him politically) and also hurts the long-view cause of Progressivism (which is what we liberal friends care most about).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, he has occasionally advocated for progressive values. He has also fallen time and again into Republican traps like &quot;the government is like a family budget&quot;, not to mention the times he has actively taken the other side (single payer / public option health care, Gitmo, investigating war crimes committed by Bush-era military and CIA, etc. etc.). Whatever he&#39;s done, if you call it leading, well, I don&#39;t think that word means what you think it means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_09/on_leadership032514.php&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;On leadership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/&quot; class=&quot;ot-origin-anchor&quot;&gt;2011 Political Animal&lt;/a&gt;</div>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Alex re-read that comment. It&#39;s pretty weak and sort of depressing.<br /><br />If you&#39;re going to go down this path at least show us a counterfactual. In the real world, in real America, given the possibilities, how is a president supposed to do better? The most productive liberal congress in a generation wasn&#39;t good enough for you. I mean, if you&#39;re the Obama people, and you hear shit like this - unconstructive, wish-fullfillment-based critique, wouldn&#39;t you start to ignore, and even ridicule it after a while?<br /><br />Sigh.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">What do you mean &quot;after a while?&quot; He&#39;s been ignoring us (and btw himself during the campaign) from day one. He took single payer and the public option off the table. He didn&#39;t break up the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks. He had one halfass &lt;$1T dollar stimulus that was half tax cuts and then he started talking austerity like the rest of the idiots. He was scared of the CIA so he didn&#39;t investigate war crimes. He was scared of the bankers and let himself get pushed around by the Goldman Sachs crowd. He was scared of the Republicans so he precompromised and used their language on every domestic issue until just last month -- not even last year when it might have done some electoral good, or this year when the Republicans were unsteady (remember them screwing up the Constitution Singalong?) -- he just let them gain their footing and then shove the &quot;job creator&quot; and &quot;family budget&quot; and &quot;class warfare&quot; bullshit down our throats and even start spouting it himself.<br /><br />When he lost he didn&#39;t lose well and when he won he managed not to get credit for it. It was sad that he didn&#39;t follow the left&#39;s messaging advice before, and it&#39;s sad now that he&#39;s blaming them for having been correct the whole time. We&#39;ve been telling him, &quot;Um, dude, you should probably take a couple of swings soon,&quot; and now that he&#39;s bloodied and on the ropes, it&#39;s somehow our fault?<br /><br />Don&#39;t blame the messaging messenger. Obama built his reputation as an ineffective appeaser all on his own: <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" >http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll</a><br />&quot;22% of the nation&#39;s voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as president. Forty-two percent (42%) Strongly Disapprove... Fifty-three percent (53%) at least somewhat disapprove.&quot;<br /><br />Believe me, those 53% are not listening to me or Gerry Canavan or Paul Krugman. They have decided all on their own that he&#39;s a lily livered fuckup. <br /><br />And suddenly now he says he&#39;s a warrior for the middle class? Yeah, right. Sell that line to someone else. I&#39;m not buying.<br /><br />(And yeah, it was a pretty productive congress for a minute there. Thank you, Nancy Pelosi.)</span>
