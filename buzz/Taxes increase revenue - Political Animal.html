<span class="entry-title entry-content">Re: the parsing of the first quotation, it is slightly ambiguous whether &quot;promising not to raise taxes&quot; is a way in which he is attacking budget deficit or a similarity he has with a growing group of governors.  The reason I say it is only slightly ambiguous is because, as the writer points out, not raising taxes is generally not a good way to lower a deficit.  <br /><br />In other words, the writer seems to be (intentionally?) misconstruing a slight ambiguity and making a big fuss over it.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">If the reporter were at all good at his job, he wouldn&#39;t have left that ambiguity in in the first place; moreover, he would have explicitly mentioned the inconsistency in Christie&#39;s position. As written, the only takeaway is &quot;attacking yawning budget deficits&quot;. Even changing &quot;and&quot; to &quot;while&quot; would have been better, i.e. more objective and factual vs. buying into the framing.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Oh no doubt.  Not the greatest sentence ever, but when I read it, I understood what it meant and did not for a second think that the Post was implying that not raising taxes would help fix the deficit.  <br /><br />As the writer says, it is crazy to say that not raising taxes will help fix the deficit.  The question remains then why, if the sentence is susceptible to two interpretations, one crazy and one totally reasonable, he decides to assume that the Post was going for the crazy one.<br /><br />If you want to talk about objectivity, I would say that this type of analysis is far less objective than the Post&#39;s choice of using &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;while.&quot;  <br /><br />I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that lowering taxes will help lower the deficit.  They are saying that the deficit is too high and at this point in time it would be better to cut spending than to raise taxes.  Now I&#39;m not saying I agree with this line of thinking, and there is a great argument to be made for making tax more progressive (rather than lower the pay/benefits of the middle classes) to fill in this gap, but I think that if there is to be debate on this topic, it should be straightforward.  <br /><br />These straw man arguments just make the person proposing them look as though he does not have a more logical argument.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I didn&#39;t think I was saying anything positive about the republicans.  I am saying that this particular blog is intentionally misinterpreting the newspaper&#39;s words to support some conspiracy theory that the Washington Post is trying to tilt its coverage in favor of Chris Christie.<br /><br />Also, if you are so interested in unbiased reporting that it is a big deal if the Post used  &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;while,&quot; I am amazed that you are linking to Rachel Maddow, who while very intelligent, is insanely partisan.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">OK thanks for watching it :-)<br /><br />I see Rachel not as &quot;partisan&quot; (which implies allegiance to a party) but as having a clear perspective. She often rags on Democrats, and also bucks the liberal line when science or experts or just her own huge brain lead towards a different conclusion. <br /><br />One thing I really appreciate about her style is her effective use of repetition (and other pedagogic techniques) to convey a point which may otherwise be lost in the flow of news or in the audience&#39;s own bias. Her reports are often essays.<br /><br />So, back to the original discussion: by &quot;giving the Republicans too much benefit of the doubt&quot; I mean you are not recognizing that they are not arguing in good faith. Your points, including the one quoted by Kevin, are well taken, but don&#39;t actually match the debate that&#39;s being played out right now in the media and the state governments. Instead of &quot;saying that the deficit is too high and at this point in time it would be better to cut spending than to raise taxes&quot; they are actually saying that the deficit is too high and in addition to cutting spending they also want to introduce new tax cuts, mostly for businesses and millionaires, often equalling or surpassing the value of the spending cuts, and then failing to admit that those tax cuts will make the deficit worse, not better. They&#39;re using the budget crisis as a smoke screen in order to smuggle in social and economic priorities that go precisely counter to their professed number one priority (which is either &quot;jobs jobs jobs&quot; or balancing the budget, depending on when they say it). That fits the dictionary definition of hypocrisy, with some extra sleaze thrown in.<br /><br />Like you, I&#39;d love to hear an honest debate. The only place I&#39;m hearing actual honesty is on the Rachel Maddow Show.</span>

That is, no companies would leave and the same amount companies would relocate to a given state if incentives were offered or not offered.  I find that implication difficult to believe.<br /><br />States compete for businesses in a beggar-thy-neighbor &quot;market.&quot;<br /><br />P.S. I agree with Maddow that the attack on unions have more to do with unions funding Democratic candidates than costs.<br /><br />@James buy a nightlight.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I agree that the Republicans are using the crisis to attack unions, in part, because they fund the Dems. I also think that they believe that there is a lot of savings to be had by cutting union benefits.  I do not know whether the end result of their efforts will be to raise or lower the deficit.  <br /><br />Like Kevin said, you can only raise corporate taxes so much before companies start leaving and lowering them might encourage some to stay, or new ones to set up in state.  That&#39;s why I take issue with Maddow&#39;s argument in that segment you linked to.  Sure, lowering the corporate tax will decrease revenue all other things being equal, but it isn&#39;t that simple.  I think she knows that, but leaves it out because it would weaken her point.  <br /><br />I don&#39;t think either party is particularly honest, which is why I try to seek out unbiased news coverage.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">If that&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve heard mention of it, it is because you are only reading liberal news outlets and blogs.  Do you really think that you can just raise corporate taxes nonstop and companies won&#39;t leave, or that they won&#39;t factor it into their decision to move to a state? <br /><br />Whether or not it will have an instant effect, or whether taxes aren&#39;t already too low is certainly a valid concern, but to say that it will have absolutely no effect on a company&#39;s decision as to where to locate is crazy. <br /><br />I agree with Steve.  When I say unbiased, I mean intellectually honest.  I don&#39;t think Maddow and O&#39;Reilly are intellectually honest.  Maddow is just smarter so she is better at hiding it.  <br /><br />I am not saying that lowering corporate taxes is the right move, I am only saying to to portray it as crazy, hypocritical and without any justification at any time is a really simplified way of looking at things.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">So that would be a nice debate to be having on teevee. The reason I say balderdash is because corporations already pay so little in taxes, and the income disparities are so great, that it&#39;d be like fighting fire with gasoline. See e.g. the recent NYT story about GE.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">You have to distinguish between state and federal taxes.  No doubt GE is not paying enough taxes, but those are mainly due to federal handouts, which I suspect were given to GE Capital during the crisis, although you&#39;d need a much better tax law background than I have to figure it out.  The U.S. actually has a very high corporate tax rate, but there are so many loopholes that large companies with aggressive tax/lobbying departments are able to make the effective rate much lower.   Small companies generally end up paying way more.  I believe Obama actually wants to lower the highest rate and remove the loopholes.    <br /><br />Here&#39;s an article on state tax competition, most recent time I remember it coming up:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/living_on_the_hedge_Nv8mbQtT1owRYGkYaSsELP" >http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/living_on_the_hedge_Nv8mbQtT1owRYGkYaSsELP</a></span>
