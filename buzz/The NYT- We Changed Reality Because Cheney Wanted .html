<span class="entry-title entry-content">It&#39;s a case of making something out of nothing.  The NYT had to stop referring to waterboarding as torture or the critics would claim that they&#39;re politicizing the news.  I don&#39;t see a problem as long as they still told you that the waterboarding happened.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Change &quot;waterboarding, which some call torture&quot; to &quot;evolution, which some call science&quot; or &quot;AIDS, which may or may not be spread by public toilets&quot; and you may see the problem. Teaching the controversy means the liars win.<br /><br />And those who say waterboarding is not torture are not merely expressing a political opinion; they are lying: &quot;But it is not an opinion that waterboarding is torture; it is a fact, recognized by everyone on the planet as such - and by the NYT in its news pages as such - for centuries. What we have here is an admission that the NYT did change its own established position to accommodate the Cheneyite right.&quot;<br /><br />(Hey, this is a fun game! &quot;possible Kenyan citizen Barack Obama&quot;, &quot;George W.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">If you change, &quot;The agents tortured the prisoner,&quot; to &quot;The agents waterboarded the prisoner,&quot; what information is lost?  Or, if you change that to, &quot;The agents waterboarded the prisoner.  Waterboarding is considered torture by the Geneva Conventions,&quot; what&#39;s lost?<br /><br />I agree with what the NYT did.  I also think waterboarding is torture.  Why open yourself up to criticisms of politicizing the news if you don&#39;t have to?<br /><br />The NYT&#39;s most valuable asset is its credibility.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Kevin I think you&#39;re missing something pretty huge.  I think this is necessary background:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm" >http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a><br /><br />Also:<br /><br />&quot;The way newspapers characterize practices like waterboarding has an immediate impact on the attitudes adopted by their readers. Accepting the language suggested by the Bush Administration (“enhanced interrogation techniques”) helped build public acceptance for the application of torture techniques. Victor Klemperer, in his masterful study of the manipulation of language in Germany from the thirties to the end of World War II, called such phrases “little doses of arsenic: they are consumed without being noticed; they seem at first to have no effect, but after a while, indeed, the effect is there.”<br /><br />In his impressive attempt to catalogue these “doses of arsenic,” Klemperer awards pride of place to the words used by the state to describe prisoners, prison camps, and the treatments to which they were subjected. Indeed, one of the phrases developed in this era is still with us today. In special circumstances and usually only with the permission of higher authorities, interrogators were permitted to use a set of highly coercive techniques on prisoners, including hypothermia and stress positions. These techniques were called verschärfte Vernehmung: “enhanced interrogation.”&quot;<br /><br /><br />If I steal from you and I claim it&#39;s not stealing, does that make it not stealing?  If I get everyone to start thinking I have a legitimate argument that long-term borrowing is ok, does that make stealing ok?<br /><br />&quot;Purging&quot;, &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, etc - these were all once positive-sounding euphemisms that criminal regimes used to their advantage.  I don&#39;t see why newspapers ought to be tolerated that are complicit in this kind of thing.<br /><br />Are you a committed postmodernist?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Orwell does have a point. Fortunately, there&#39;s a countervailing sociolinguistic force at work: over time, the euphemism tends to acquire the same stigma as the original term. My favorite example is the parade of terms used to describe mentally deficient individuals: half-wit, idiot, moron, retarded, challenged, special -- each was adopted in order to remove the stigma associated with the previous term, and each soon reacquired the stigma. I think the same thing has now happened with “enhanced interrogation” -- people pretty much know it means torture.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t excuse what happened at the time, though, and &quot;pretty much&quot; is very far from perfect, since it still leaves a hole for torture advocates to pretend they&#39;re not pro-torture.<br /><br />BTW thanks for the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; example -- it never occurred to me that it would sound positive to some people, but it makes sense that it was a euphemism for genocide.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I don&#39;t agree with the stealing analogy.  If you&#39;re reporting on the theft and it seems that a good portion of your readers now consider the theft to be borrowing, what do you do?  Do you alienate the readers that think it was borrowing and compromise your objectivity?  Do you risk putting yourself out of business?<br /><br />If you say that they should have kept calling torture, how do you report Cheney or whoever saying it&#39;s not torture with out making the story sound like something that should be on the editorial page?  Should you not empathize with the subject of your vilification?  I didn&#39;t like the lack of fact gathering before ranting.  Sentences weren&#39;t examined.  Claims of &quot;obfuscating the truth,&quot; seem ridiculous.  Waterboarding is still waterboarding.<br /><br />I get the point that the word change detracts from the seriousness of the crime.<br /><br />&quot;The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another.&quot;  Postmodernist and alternative music need to be added to Orwell&#39;s list.  They both mean everything and nothing.</span>
