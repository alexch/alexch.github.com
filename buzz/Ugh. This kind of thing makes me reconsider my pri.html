<span class="entry-title entry-content">Sigh. I suppose opening this can of worms is my fault, so I&#39;ll reply...<br /><br />The issue with hate crimes is that it doesn&#39;t criminalize behavior, it criminalizes thought or intent. The same act is punished differently based on motivations the prosecutor ascribes to the perp. While this kind of thing is already all over criminal law (e.g. manslaughter vs. murder, or mitigating circumstances (he robbed the store to feed his hungry child)), it still seems like a slip too far down that particular slope.<br /><br />Or not. I could go either way, and something in me does feel it&#39;s right to punish hateful acts more severely than desperate or foolish ones.<br /><br />In this case it seems like the guy was off his rocker, so I hope he gets treatment instead of (or at least in addition to) punishment.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">There is no protected speech whatsoever in a violent act.  Even true threats are not protected speech--you have no First Amendment right to call up the guy down the street and tell him you&#39;re going to be waiting outside his house with a knife.  Stabbing someone you don&#39;t like in order to express your dislike of that person is not speech under any conceivable definition, even if it does convey a message.  Plus, our criminal law is not just rife with mental state-based distinctions, it is built upon them.  Homicide is a different crime depending whether you do it negligently (unaware of a risk), recklessly (aware of and disregarding a risk), willfully (purposefully causing the harm), or with premeditation.  In a hate crime, the intent is not only to harm the direct victim but also to harm other people who are like that victim in some way by threatening them with the same.  We can debate whether or not the criminal system is able to distinguish between ordinary crimes and hate crimes, and we can debate the merits of additional punishments for hate crimes because of their broader effect, but it&#39;s important to be clear about what&#39;s going on.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">btw thanks -- &quot;In a hate crime, the intent is not only to harm the direct victim but also to harm other people who are like that victim in some way by threatening them with the same.&quot; -- I hadn&#39;t heard it described that way before; it clarifies things a lot. The crime is not merely a crime, but also a threat.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;I agree that motivation is meaningful for sentencing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worthy of a separate class of crime though. &quot;<br /><br />Um, how about murder vs manslaughter?<br /><br />Motivation pervades the legal system, it pervades it because it&#39;s a basic part of our moral sense.  If I kill you intentionally and a jury believes I killed you because you&#39;re black, and you spend 5 more years in jail than you otherwise would, I don&#39;t see why that is so different from other things we do to people because a jury is unanimously convinced of some thing.<br /><br />It&#39;s not double jeopardy or anything &quot;wrong&quot;, it&#39;s a community making up rules because the community thinks certain values are important.  Nothing wrong with that.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Kevin, all you&#39;re saying is you care about the distinction between negligent/reckless acts and intentional ones, and you don&#39;t care about the distinction between different kinds of intent.  But the criminal law we have distinguishes between intents already -- e.g., compare voluntary manslaughter (you intentionally kill the person you catch in bed with your spouse in the heat of the moment) with felony murder (you intended to commit a dangerous felony, but didn&#39;t specifically intend for anyone to die) with premeditated murder (you laid in wait).<br /><br />Alex, that threat idea is how I conceive of hate crime, but it&#39;s not uncontroversial.  For ex, suppose Perpetrator was just out joyriding and saw Victim, a person of an ethnic group he didn&#39;t like, and decided to hit him with the car.  No intent to threaten others, but motivated by racial animus.  Hate crime?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Erin The way I see it, the distinguishing factor between each one of those crimes is the amount of planning involved before the crime was committed.  Those are the distinctions worth caring about.<br /><br />With hate crimes, we&#39;re saying that there&#39;s a difference between premeditated murder and premeditated murder because the victim was gay, black, disabled, etc.<br /><br />I can&#39;t think of a premeditated murder that didn&#39;t involve lots of hate.  I can&#39;t think of a premeditated murderer that isn&#39;t a threat to society.<br /><br />I take issue with society saying that murdering a black person is somehow worse than murdering a white person.  I take issue that its somehow a lesser offense to assault someone to an inch of his life because he looked like an easy target than it is to assault a gay person to an inch of his life.  It&#39;s all wrong, it&#39;s all unacceptable, and should be dealt with equally.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Kevin, <i>no one</i> is saying that crimes against black or gay people are worse than corresponding crimes against white or straight people.  I&#39;m saying that there is a plausible reason to view crimes against <i>anyone</i> based on the class to which they belong as worse than crimes directed solely at a single victim.  That&#39;s because crimes which have the intent or effect of terrorizing a group of people are more harmful.  <br /><br />Imagine you live in an area where you&#39;re in the minority.  Imagine there have been a string of assaults, muggings, and robberies directed against people who look like you over the last 3 months.  Would you be comfortable walking home alone at night?  Would you feel like you didn&#39;t belong in your own neighborhood anymore?  Would you view the (majority-group) people around you with suspicion or fear?  Hate crimes cause harm by separating classes of people from the rest of society.  Yes, all crimes are bad and should be punished, but there is a real difference between demanding any random person&#39;s wallet at gunpoint and burning a cross on particular peoples&#39; front lawns.</span>

I can&#39;t think of a premeditated murderer that isn&#39;t a threat to society.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s a very narrow view of what matters to society - in fact I accuse you of being intentionally dense to try and make a point.

In fact those who are against hate crimes but are accepting of the premise of aggravating factors are simply expressing a taste preference against race/gender/sexual orientation/etc as worthy of consideration.<br /><br />The victim was 62 years of age or older<br />The victim was severely handicapped or disabled<br />The victim was pregnant<br />The victim was a government employee, including peace officers, police officers, federal agents, firefighters, judges, jurors, defense attorneys, and prosecutors, in the course of his or her duties<br /><br />==&gt;<br /><br />The victim was gay and the crime was likely (in the judgement of the jury) motivated by sexual orientation<br /><br />Easy!</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">@Erin I agree that no one is saying that it&#39;s worse, because it&#39;s only implied.  If you commit a certain crime, you&#39;re subject this sentence.  If you commit that same crime against a protected class of citizens, you get this worse sentence.<br /><br />I do see the reasoning behind the hate crime laws.  I don&#39;t agree with your reasoning though.  I don&#39;t think a minority feels safer until the perpetrators of the crimes are apprehended.  I doubt that screaming, &quot;I&#39;m protected by hate crime laws&quot;, will deter an assailant.  I&#39;ll admit that if the FBI is able to get involved because it&#39;s now a federal crime as well, it could assist in stopping the crimes.  It would make even more of difference if the locals are reluctant to do anything.<br /><br />Frankly, that&#39;s the only good thing about hate crimes.  They allow some other government crime unit to come in and correct the indifference of the local agency.  Such laws should sunset and be restricted to areas where the problem exists.<br /><br />@Steve I&#39;ll admit to being naturally dense.  I didn&#39;t go out my way to make a dense point.  Violent race crimes were a problem 50 years ago.  The local police would turn a blind eye to the transgressions.  It was a problem.  Is it still a problem?  I don&#39;t think so.  Would society regress if African-Americans were removed from the protected class?  I doubt it.<br /><br />The aggravating factor list is BS.  It&#39;s touted as a deterrent, but it doesn&#39;t affect criminal behavior.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I don&#39;t know if the aggravating factors/hate crime sentencing guidelines as a deterrent has been studied much.  I did some googling, but didn&#39;t come up with much.<br /><br />Three things lead me to that opinion:<br />1.  There have been lots of studies showing that the death penalty isn&#39;t a deterrent.  Here&#39;s one, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01168.x/abstract" >http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01168.x/abstract</a><br />A consensus hasn&#39;t been reached in the academic world, but after living in Texas for 33 years, I&#39;m inclined to agree that it&#39;s not a deterrent.  If losing your life isn&#39;t a deterrent, what is?<br /><br />2.  Law of diminishing returns.  Adding a few more years on to a sentence that&#39;s already decades long, isn&#39;t going to suddenly become a deterrent if it wasn&#39;t already.<br /><br />3.  General ignorance of an aggravating factors.  It can&#39;t be a deterrent unless it&#39;s known.<br /><br />I suspect that we have these aggravating factors not because they work, but because politicians can&#39;t vote no for them with out opening themselves up to a &quot;soft of crime&quot; attack.<br /><br />Which statement about blacks should I email Ta-Nehisi Coates?   This one?  &quot;Would society regress if African-Americans were removed from the protected class? I doubt it.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that violence against blacks isn&#39;t a problem anymore.  I&#39;m saying that if the hate crime laws were to be removed, the crime rate against blacks wouldn&#39;t suddenly rise.<br /><br />And yeah, violence against gays is still a problem, but are hate crime laws making a difference?  Only in areas where the laws are enforced unfairly.  Where they are enforced fairly, I don&#39;t think it matters.</span>
