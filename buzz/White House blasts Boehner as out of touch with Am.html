<span class="entry-title entry-content">Important information for whom?  Only the people in his district can do something about him.  Being in touch with America is not a criteria from which they elect a party leader in the house.<br /><br />No matter who is selected as a leader in the house, for either party, its arguable that they are out of touch with America.  I bet you couldn&#39;t find 5 people in Boehner&#39;s district who think that Nancy Pelosi IS in touch with America.  I think I&#39;ve seen polls that show that Americans think Congress, in general, is out of touch.  Perhaps that&#39;s the reason for Steve Conover&#39;s comment.<br /><br />and I agree with Jordan&#39;s statement of the obvious.<br /><br />(I&#39;m glad you can edit these things.  Way too many awful grammar errors)</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;Perhaps that&#39;s the reason for Steve Conover&#39;s comment. &quot;<br /><br />No, it&#39;s the whole netroot Obama-needs-to-fight trope.  They want him to do a little dance every day so they&#39;re entertained in their feed readers and have something to share on their facebook pages or something.  They want like the netroot equivalent of Obama going to stand on the beach in Mississippi and waste time and energy - a pointless exercise.<br /><br />But it&#39;ll &quot;change the narrative&quot;, and Nelson and Lieberman and Lincoln will suddenly be pressured by their constituencies to vote for public options and such.  They may make fun of the reality-based community idea but man do they totally buy into it.<br /><br />It&#39;s another reminder of how out of step with reality they all are - that includes Tom Tomorrow.  Check out the FACTS about passage of progressive legislation, compare Obama&#39;s first year+ to any in history.  They&#39;re totally ungrateful, and in some cases it goes beyond loyal opposition - Hamsher/Dean on HCR should not be forgotten.  They&#39;re leading figures in that movement.  It&#39;s kind of obvious to me at least (perhaps I&#39;m deluded in my little strawman world!) that netroots are much more comfortable - &quot;in their element&quot;, might be the right phrase - in a W wins / Dean loses climate - you don&#39;t have the messy compromises inherent in governance and legislating, but you can think about the idyllic administration you would run, and throw ideologically pure candidates up in elections and see them get voted down -that just heightens the umbrage, the dissatisfaction, the will to fight.<br /><br />That&#39;s the dominant attitude on the right at the moment, which I have to think is in large part why they&#39;re going to lose big-time in 2012.  The base wants to lose, down deep.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">The right is idyllic?  I hope you&#39;re referring to the simplicity of &#39;no.&#39;  That&#39;s about all they stand for these days.  Ron Paul is about the only the the Republicans have that is even half ideologically pure.  The half he doesn&#39;t fall in line with costs him the religious vote.  We know how his story ends.  The rest are an ideological mess.  It&#39;s a lot of science hating and limited government except for these things rhetoric.<br /><br />I get the feeling that a lot of people actually believed Obama when he said what he believed in, despite the fact that he&#39;s a politician.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">&quot;I get the feeling that a lot of people actually believed Obama when he said what he believed in, despite the fact that he&#39;s a politician.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#39;t get this either.  Well ok, if you look at Guantanamao and human rights, the record isn&#39;t good, but you know what I see?  A guy who, with few exceptions, spend two years campaigning, at every stop going down a list of things he was going to do as president, and laying out what were the top priorities.  And he&#39;s executed on them!  Really!<br /><br />If the claim is that he promised a lot during the campaign and then hasn&#39;t done every last thing in a year and a half, or that he promised things during the campaign that no president could possibly deliver on, you just described every president and candidate going back 50+ years at least.  In fact that might describe every politician going back all through Homo Sapiens Sapiens.<br /><br />Or if this claim is that his motives are questionable, or he&#39;s an opportunistic hack, that&#39;s unfalsifiable.  I think he&#39;s one of the more consistent politicians around - laying out a governing philosophy in great detail and then sticking to it (agree or disagree - and I&#39;d say W was consistent and not too much of a hack, but turned out to be the worst president of all time, so this &quot;virtue&quot; only goes so far) - but maybe that&#39;s just me.<br /><br />And here&#39;s a question: who was this president who wasn&#39;t a &quot;politician&quot;?  Who didn&#39;t overpromise in the campaign?  Who didn&#39;t inspire people and then disappoint once he had to govern?<br /><br />And finally, just to stand up for politicians for a moment.  Yes, they are freaks of nature.  But isn&#39;t it a little boring after a while to just assume they&#39;re all scum?  Is it possible that one or two are really devoted to public service and trying to do the right thing?  Who thinks Joe Biden isn&#39;t one of those people, or Michelle Obama, or Reagan?  What reason do you have to believe that Obama is some calculating hack?</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">It might be boring, but boring can be true too.  I think that &#39;scum&#39; is too harsh of a word.  &#39;Politician&#39; is what they prefer to be called.  They&#39;re hardly the only ones who put their interests first in this crazy world.<br /><br />Yes, civil rights is a good example of where Obama has done a 180.  It&#39;s not just Gitmo.  It&#39;s pressing for continued eavesdropping, not letting the Patriot act sunset, ordering Kagan to press on with the case to argue that Feds can hold a prisoner past the end of his sentence.  All those things contradict his campaign stump speeches.  Those are hardly the compromises of the political process.<br /><br />Then there&#39;s the devious votes that congress typically goes through.  You know, the ones where they vote one way when they know the bill doesn&#39;t have a chance.  Then, when it matters, they vote the other way.  When campaign season arrives, they can claim they were for/against whatever they want.  Genius!  That happened just yesterday when the audit the fed amendment failed.  Previously, it had passed by an over-whelming margin, 320 votes, with the knowledge that it wouldn&#39;t get passed by the senate.  Yesterday, when voting to attach it to the finance reform bill, it went down in flames, only 198 in favor.  Sure, it&#39;s arguable that it would made the bill harder to pass in the senate and that&#39;s why so many votes changed.  I&#39;ll only remind you exactly how many constituents the Fed has.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Yep.  How could auditing the Fed possibly not be in the best interest of the majority of American citizens?  Please tell me.  Yet it failed.  Could it be because it is not in the best interest of Congress (would would actually have to make hard economic decisions without blank check treasury purchases from the Fed) or the banks which comprise the Fed (who would have to explain exactly how they get negative-interest loans from the Fed to go bet in the market).<br /><br />They won&#39;t shit where they eat.</span>
