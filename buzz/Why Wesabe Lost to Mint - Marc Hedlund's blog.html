<span class="entry-title entry-content">He&#39;s right, even though I really wanted to use them, they didn&#39;t offer automated integration.<br /><br />He&#39;s also right that Mint sucks.<br /><br />However, I believe the best approach to really help people be successful with budgeting is the envelope system.  Mvelopes.com does that best, and has great bank integration (probably via Yodlee).  So, I use them, even though they have a horribly shitty slow flash UI...<br /><br />However, now that they&#39;ve open sourced Wesabe, maybe there will be something better, but only if they can still let you leverage Yodlee&#39;s integration...</span>

The history of which you speak holds more evidence of corruption and woe caused by banks having too much power, and creating havoc via various manipulations, such as the gold and silver standard.  There are many examples of long periods of economic stability, including in the US, when the money supply was controlled by the government, but kept in balance with little to no inflation, and with enough money supply to facilitate economic activity.<br /><br />I also don&#39;t see why it would be insane to let the GOVERNMENT control the money supply, or at least any less sane than letting private solely-for-profit corporate entities control it.<br /><br />The current system is true insanity!  The Fed is PRIVATE BANKS.  It has US taxpayers go into DEBT to create money which it distributes among member banks and other banking institutions, and they PROFIT off of the interest!!!<br /><br />Why not cut out the middle man, especially when that middle man is a corporate entity with NO LEGAL OBLIGATION other than increasing shareholder value?  At least the government is ostensibly supposed to represent the interests of the citizens, private banks can&#39;t claim that whatsoever..<br /><br />Why not let the government control the money supply: SPEND money into existence for infrastructure, job creation and other stimulus; make direct loans to citizens and businesses at low interest, with the interest profit going to support government operations; and all of this resulting in lower (or no) taxes and deficits.  Sure, there would be opportunity for corruption and mismanagement of the money supply by government officials, but could it really be any worse than with Fed member banks controlling the money supply IN SECRET?  Judging from the current state of the nation&#39;s balance sheet and cash flow and debt level of the average citizen, I personally would be willing to take my chances.<br /><br />As for Fractional Reserve lending, why the hell do bank corporate entities have the right to create money out of thin air and earn interest on it, when I, as a human American citizen entity, do not?  It would sure come in handy for me, lemme tellya.  It seems strangely correlated that they make billions of dollars in profit, while I and most of the rest of America labour in debt servitude to them.  And I knew better, most of the people they screw are too ignorant to even know how they are being trapped.<br /><br />And if you think that Fractional Reserve Lending is NECESSARY for lending, I point to all the successful credit unions in America as proof that you are wrong.  Maybe not lending on the scale which multinational corporations need, but I see that natural limiting factor of actual reserves on lending and economic growth (or lately, primarily fraudulent financial derivatives and housing bubble growth) as a very healthy thing.<br /><br />Banks don&#39;t have to be eliminated, they just have to play on a level field with everyone else.  Regulations could be changed to encourage state- and municipality-owned banks, with no fractional reserve lending, and all of the interest profit being reinvested locally rather than going to profit private corporations.<br /><br />These actions seem like a win-win situation for government, states, citizens, and all non-fractional-reserve based financial institutions - with the only losers being banks, their shareholders, and the politicians they pay off to maintain the status quo.<br /><br />Please tell me how this is insane...</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I am all for auditing the Fed.  It is a shame that Ron Paul&#39;s amendment failed when almost the entire house was co-sponsoring his bill.<br /><br />If you can charter a bank, your bank is free to join to federal reserve and to make use of their overnight window or other services.  <a href="http://www.bos.frb.org/bankinfo/members/member.pdf" >http://www.bos.frb.org/bankinfo/members/member.pdf</a><br /><br />Bringing credit unions into the discussion undermines much of competition argument.  Credit unions are not part of the Federal Reserve system, yet they do quite well.  Credit unions do lend out money, promise all the money deposited, and therefore are participating in fractional reserve banking.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to mention that you are free to purchase stock in these money printing institutions.  All the big private institutions are publicly traded.  If they&#39;re as profitable as you say, it&#39;s probably a good idea.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">actually Chad, excess Fed profit is deposited into the US treasury as supplemental income into the general fund.<br /><br />why not let the gov&#39;t control money supply?  because the money supply will one day be a campaign issue and that supply will be manipulated not by standard formulas and educated guesses (which a lot of macroeconomics is), but rather by populist campaign promises and political maneuvering which will have a detrimental impact to society.  Money policy needs to be kept independent of the gov&#39;t.  History has taught us this over and over again.<br /><br />the money supply is not managed in secret.  it is managed by lowering/increasing the reserve requirement (a mechanism I wish were used much more often) and open market purchases/redemption of treasury bonds (also MBS&#39;s after the financial crisis).  <br /><br />the first time money is created and deposited, that strain of money will generally be stretched over 10 iterations (or so, depending on the reserve requirement) creating phantom money (M2).  at that point, however, no new money can be created - it&#39;s all in use in the system.  keep that point in mind - today, new money is &quot;created out of thin air&quot; only when new debt is created by the federal government.  That money flows to the people, who deposit the money, which then spreads out over several iterations until it&#39;s &quot;done.&quot;  Right now, we&#39;re creating upwards of $1.3TT per year of new money.  That money is going to go through about 10-12 iterations.  You do the math from there.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure fractional reserve banking is the real culprit here.  I would instead start looking at the systemic changes to the commercial banking industry regulation that began in the 1970&#39;s.  Banks being allowed to buy other banks, exemption from state urury laws, commercial banking and underwriting under a single corporate umbrella, the ability for banks to create additional M2 money by moving loans off balance sheet through securitization, etc.  Granted, we would probably not be as far advanced in technology, education, or infrastructure had we NOT allowed many of these things (remember - the creation of money also allows rapid economic growth), but I wonder if we&#39;d be a better <b>society in general</b> had we been more conservative with our banking system.  Not sure.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Oh, BTW...  Credit Unions do, in fact, participate in fractional reserve banking.  The difference between CUs and commercial banks is that CUs are owned by the depositors and are not-for-profit entities.

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I doubt the Fed would consider QE ex nihilio.  They would expand the types of assets and instruments they would consider purchasing on the open market, creating new money to purchase it.  Corporate bonds, maybe?  Either way, its a desperate attempt and the world knows it.  The moment they implement that type of easing, the quality of the dollar will drop quite sharply and the T-Bill rate will climb to tremendous highs.  That <b>will</b> be the beginning of the double-dip.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">OK, I guess credit unions must engage in some fractional reserve lending.  There are demand deposits, and time deposits.  It is unclear and interesting, I&#39;ll have to look more.  However, they are nonprofits, so any excess revenue benefits the members, which usually primarily represents the local economy.  Contrast this with for-profit banks which extract interest and fee income and transfer it to the bank&#39;s shareholders and officers.<br /><br /> I know the Fed deposits excess &quot;profit&quot; back, but the government still goes into debt, and the banks to which they lend (which are themselves!) keep the profit from inflated interest and fractional reserve lending.  Again, why do citizens have to go into debt to create their own money supply?  Money should be a store of value to facilitate economic activity, NOT debt which serves to benefit banks!<br /><br />I also disagree that money supply must be privately controlled.  This is a myth created by banking institutions over the last century!  There are many examples of government-controlled money supply working - such as the Continental and the Greenback in the United States.  Both of these currencies were successful until subverted by banking interests.<br /><br />Finally, you are all missing the fundamental flaw in fractional reserve banking and a debt-based money supply controlled by private banks:<br /><br />  How does it all ever get paid back?<br /><br />The answer is, it can&#39;t.  It is impossible.  If every dollar must be lent into existence, and paid back with interest, where does the interest come from?  The answer is nowhere!  You have to rob Peter to pay Paul.  That is why almost everyone, including the government, is in debt to banking institutions!<br /><br />Isn&#39;t the solution is to remove the debt-based approach to money, and return to a monetary system where money is just money - a medium of exchange, a store of value to facilitate economic activity.  Why can&#39;t the money supply be controlled by the federal government?  You don&#39;t have to throw out all the economic seers and their formulas and tea leaves - just make them all federal employees, and simply disburse newly created money directly from the Treasury, instead of making the taxpayers go into debt to create it!  Some can be used for infrastructure, and some can be lent.  State- and municipality-owned banking institutions can all borrow and re-lend created funds, as well as any non-profit credit unions or private banks which can survive based on offering different or better services.  It is essentially the same system, except that the government doesn&#39;t have to rely on debt (and the resulting taxation) to create money!<br /><br />You still haven&#39;t convinced me why the current system, which is obviously deeply flawed, broken, and unsustainable, and resulting in obscenely large profits for banks and obscenely large debt for the US, is superior to this... <br /><br />Here&#39;s a cartoon!  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5352106773770802849#" >http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5352106773770802849#</a><br /><br />And a book:  <a href="http://www.webofdebt.com/" >http://www.webofdebt.com/</a></span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">i&#39;m not debating that the current system (fiat currency, independent central banking) is flawless or a better system than alternatives such as an asset-backed-currency (which is what I think you&#39;re proposing).  That said, asset-backed currency systems have their own set of drawbacks which are different, but very much equal in their negative ramifications.  For example, without an open market for currency exchange with an elastic fiat currency, global trade becomes near impossible due to the unavailability of the importer&#39;s currency.  It would require all currency regimes to hold some kind of solid asset (such as gold) to back their currencies.  Yes, it sounds like a great, logical idea.  But I would encourage you to re-read some literature on the circumstances of WW1 and WW2 - many of the underlying reasons those wars started was because of currency manipulation by sovereign nations.  Since rare assets like gold are, well, rare, there simply isn&#39;t enough gold to go around to support the world economy.  If we switched to a gold-backed dollar, someone&#39;s 14k gold ring would be essentially worth upwards of $2MM in real terms.<br /><br />It&#39;s not a matter of whether one system is &quot;better&quot; than the other, its a matter of whether a system can support the needs and demands of the world economy.  No one can say one way or the other which is better as there are millions (literally) of variables in the analysis of macroeconomics, of which we understand maybe 30% of them.  Then there&#39;s people - those nasty, disgusting people with those pesky emotions such as greed, envy, and jealousy - who tend, no matter the system, to want to manipulate any system for their own benefit.  Think:  Nixon and the Bretton Woods agreement.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />This was a fun discussion, btw :)</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Michael,<br /><br />Wow, I thought my heresy was coming across clearer.<br /><br />No, I am definitely NOT advocating an asset-backed currency.  That&#39;s what caused all the problems at the end of the 19th century, and allowed the coup which established the Fed (again, all manipulated by banking interests).<br /><br />Asset-backed currencies are flawed because there is a finite amount of the backing asset, which makes it too easy for the rich (BANKS) to corner the market on the asset and screw everybody else.<br /><br />I&#39;m advocating for a purely fiat currency, managed by the government.  NOT debt-based as we have now, and not asset-based as we had prior to that (up until the Nixon Shock).  Both of those have been proven failures, while properly-managed fiat currencies have enjoyed long periods of success throughout history.<br /><br />As for your mention of the negative impacts on global trade - here&#39;s where I&#39;ll get truly heretical.  Globalism is our species&#39; greatest problem.  It is merely a means for the rich to oppress the poor on an even grander scale than they ever have (and they always have), and to hasten the omnicidal, suicidal extraction, waste, and destruction of our planet&#39;s finite resources.<br /><br />I&#39;m all for isolationism.  The US is a resource-rich country, we don&#39;t NEED globalism, and the need for infinite exponential economic growth is just a lie.  In fact, anytime you hear the word &#39;growth&#39; instead of &#39;sustainability&#39;, you KNOW it is a lie, because any compound growth is exponential in the long run, and exponential curves quickly reach infinity, which is not possible in our real finite world.  What happens instead in the real world is crushing collapse.  View the full DJIA history on a linear (non-logarithmic) scale, and look at &#39;99 and &#39;07.  That&#39;s what happens when you start trying to climb an exponential slope in the real world.<br /><br />If we could just get off the petroleum crack pipe, and mind our own business while the rest of the world minds theirs, we&#39;d be much better off.  And would not have to worry about any negative impact of global trade on a US-government-managed fiat currency and monetary system.<br /><br />Trouble is, that wouldn&#39;t make the bankers or global mega-corporations any money would it?  And those with the money ultimately call all the shots...</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">I actually very much agree with you regarding globalism.  I think it&#39;s lame and it causes a runaway consumption of earth&#39;s natural resources.  Except - and here&#39;s my bleeding heart liberalism - the US might have an amazing set of resources, not every country does.  Without globalism, the world&#39;s borders would restrict resource trade.  In fact, some countries would be without some of the basics, like food and water.<br /><br />Then, wars start while countries try to get those resources, and....  well, I&#39;m sure you can then see the result.  <br /><br />Perhaps isolationism, except for needy countries?  I dunno.  But I do agree with what you said above, except for the part where gov&#39;t controls the money supply.  See my last sentence regarding people and, no matter the system, their tendency to bend the rules for their benefit.  At least outside the gov&#39;t hands, we make it a little harder for politicians to do so.  Just a little.<br /><br />One thing - you can&#39;t have currency that&#39;s just paper.  It has to be backed by <b>something</b>.  It has to represent <b>something</b>.  Currently, the US dollar represents a Federal Reserve note - backed by the full faith and credit of the US.  Your alternative is asset-backed.  You spelled out many of the issues above with that.<br /><br />Debt is not inherently evil (unless you&#39;re Muslim I suppose, and even then, their issue is with interest.  They get around it by paying &quot;up front fees&quot;).  You have to take responsibility - whether you&#39;re an individual or a government - for managing your ability to pay it back.  <br /><br />I wish we could have a society based not on working to produce crap for others to consume, but rather, based on learning about the world, universe, etc.  Learning about ourselves, about art, science, literature....  things that matter.  Things that propel our species forward, not keep us enslaved to consume.  The economy and money would then be the 3rd or 4th thing on our mind and it wouldn&#39;t be the primary life focus like it is today - it would just be a mechanism for controlling the consumption of natural resources, which is the original point of money.</span>

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Wow.  We are reaching perfect violent agreement, except for a few points.  E.g. you say:<br /><br />&quot;One thing - you can&#39;t have currency that&#39;s just paper. It has to be backed by something. It has to represent something. Currently, the US dollar represents a Federal Reserve note - backed by the full faith and credit of the US. Your alternative is asset-backed. You spelled out many of the issues above with that.&quot;<br /><br />No! I an advocating a purely fiat currency, NOT asset based.  Why does currency have to be backed by something?  The only property it MUST have is legitimacy, which essentially means that other people will accept it because they are confident that they will be able to subsequently trade it for some good of real value.<br /><br />Granted, this &quot;faith&quot; in the currency is ephemeral, but the current debt-based system is undeniably nothing but a sham to indebt everyone to the banks.  I personally am fully willing to take the risk for something new, if only the power (money) holders (i.e. banks) would permit it.  Which won&#39;t happen.<br /><br />Another alternative which I have not brought up is local currency.  Currency, as I have explained, is just a medium of exchange and store of value.  If the only things you need to procure are locallly produced goods, then a local currency is a perfectly viable alternative.  Again, adoption of this approach faces an almost insurmountable obstacle, because no power interests (e.g. banks) benefit from it, only local economies.<br /><br />Nevertheless, local currencies are successful today in some local economies.  Look it up.  It&#39;s a rare cause for optimism, and non-futile activism.<br /><br />Anyway, great discussion.  Total props to you Michael for seeing through my rhetoric and responding with thoughtful reason.  That is the only hope for our democracy.</span>
